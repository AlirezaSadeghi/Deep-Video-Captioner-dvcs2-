1012_Unbreakable_00.10.06.230-00.10.15.823	A white coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards Someone and is replaced by other medical staff.
1012_Unbreakable_00.10.23.036-00.10.23.841	He holds up a torch.
1012_Unbreakable_00.10.25.923-00.10.27.675	He examines Someone's eyes.
1012_Unbreakable_00.10.38.698-00.10.40.540	Someone stares at the other trolley.
1012_Unbreakable_00.10.49.873-00.10.53.603	They both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly.
1012_Unbreakable_00.11.15.204-00.11.17.968	Still staring at the other figure, Someone slowly shakes his head.
1012_Unbreakable_00.11.22.081-00.11.28.228	Someone shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger.
1012_Unbreakable_00.11.31.333-00.11.37.000	Someone nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads.
1012_Unbreakable_00.11.37.333-00.11.46.163	The other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages.
1012_Unbreakable_00.12.28.297-00.12.36.964	Someone walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling.
1012_Unbreakable_00.12.41.246-00.12.46.170	His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.12.46.170-00.12.53.837	Someone hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy.
1012_Unbreakable_00.12.55.327-00.13.01.242	They stare at each other.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.01.242-00.13.02.093	She moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.02.093-00.13.04.760	He puts his arm around her, gazing past her.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.05.327-00.13.13.703	She steps back, looks at Someone, then at the boy, her head on one side.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.13.703-00.13.16.598	The boy's lips move.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.22.267-00.13.23.532	The three of them stand silently for a moment.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.23.532-00.13.32.263	Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.32.797-00.13.35.464	As his parents follow, they let go of each others hands.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.38.574-00.13.43.333	A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.43.333-00.13.47.119	Flashlights go off as Someone's family steps out in the open air.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.48.031-00.13.51.698	Someone's sitting alone at the table in a small dimly lit kitchen.
1012_Unbreakable_00.13.53.397-00.14.00.395	He is staring down at the spoon he is holding against the rim of a cereal bowl.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.02.397-00.14.06.985	He nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.07.021-00.14.12.326	He walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.12.326-00.14.13.529	From inside the room, his wife looks up at him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.14.397-00.14.16.064	He stops and looks down at her.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.16.397-00.14.18.732	She is standing in front of open drawer.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.41.427-00.14.44.571	She drops her eyes momentarily, looks up again, gently.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.50.439-00.14.52.106	He continues upstairs.
1012_Unbreakable_00.14.53.420-00.15.01.450	Someone, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177.
1012_Unbreakable_00.15.04.415-00.15.05.751	In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit.
1012_Unbreakable_00.15.12.845-00.15.14.997	By the pulpit, photos cover a large board.
1012_Unbreakable_00.15.45.102-00.15.48.769	Outside the church, Someone heads towards his car.
1012_Unbreakable_00.15.51.900-00.15.59.406	He stops and looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper.
1012_Unbreakable_00.15.59.406-00.16.03.780	He turns the envelope over, frowning, before flicking open the unsealed flap.
1012_Unbreakable_00.16.17.955-00.16.30.078	He stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church.
1012_Unbreakable_00.16.31.014-00.16.32.715	In a locker room, Someone opens one of the chipped green doors.
1012_Unbreakable_00.16.54.086-00.16.55.782	He stops in the doorway of an office and takes off his baseball cap.
1012_Unbreakable_00.16.55.782-00.16.57.433	A gray haired woman with gold rimmed glasses is sitting at a computer.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.04.143-00.17.04.982	She glances at her computer screen.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.26.478-00.17.28.349	She picks up a pen.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.35.190-00.17.38.661	She makes a note and puts down the pen, still without looking at him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.39.910-00.17.41.577	She returns to her work, still ignoring him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.42.868-00.17.45.272	He pulls on his baseball cap and goes.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.45.416-00.17.51.770	A cape hooded figure stands motionless in an archway silhouetted black against the teeming rain.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.52.121-00.17.54.471	He is watching an american football training session.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.55.249-00.17.57.542	One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.57.542-00.17.59.176	He captures the ball thrown from behind and dives over the line.
1012_Unbreakable_00.17.59.176-00.18.03.306	He tosses the ball to another player and trots back again.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.05.026-00.18.12.181	Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, Someone sighs deeply.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.13.576-00.18.16.242	In the locker room, Someone towels his head and face.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.16.599-00.18.20.182	He puts his towel away and glances to his right.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.26.269-00.18.29.115	An older man is in the doorway.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.46.189-00.18.48.855	Someone stares at the locker door, and then glances at Someone.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.49.189-00.18.54.855	In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp.
1012_Unbreakable_00.18.55.189-00.18.59.855	Someone, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who's sleeping peacefully.
1012_Unbreakable_00.19.00.189-00.19.06.769	A clock on the other side of the bed says a quarter to one.
1012_Unbreakable_00.19.07.189-00.19.11.716	Someone stands at his wife's closed door.
1012_Unbreakable_00.20.41.009-00.20.45.141	Someone frowns and shakes her head.
1012_Unbreakable_00.20.56.622-00.21.01.481	From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.01.481-00.21.03.812	He is sitting in a strangely hazy living room, a photo on the wall behind, a corner table with a lamp on it.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.04.256-00.21.05.372	The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.18.505-00.21.19.171	Behind him the door opens, and a woman enters.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.21.165-00.21.24.831	She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.25.165-00.21.27.971	They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted.
1012_Unbreakable_00.21.27.971-00.21.30.501	She stands beside him, arms folded.
1012_Unbreakable_00.22.01.737-00.22.05.935	The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face.
1012_Unbreakable_00.22.22.093-00.22.29.671	The boy turns and looks at her.
1012_Unbreakable_00.22.32.295-00.22.35.694	She stands and folds her arms again.
1012_Unbreakable_00.22.39.874-00.22.41.225	He is hunched forward, head down.
1012_Unbreakable_00.22.47.467-00.22.51.202	The boy lifts his head.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.01.496-00.23.03.163	The boy goes to the window.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.03.496-00.23.05.675	Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain link fence.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.09.167-00.23.13.885	An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.20.665-00.23.25.379	Chlidren chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.25.379-00.23.33.587	Holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.33.587-00.23.51.413	He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.53.052-00.23.55.719	Inside is a brown cardboard box.
1012_Unbreakable_00.23.57.006-00.24.04.386	The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.06.388-00.24.07.356	In the box is a comic, upside down.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.12.694-00.24.16.361	Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.16.452-00.24.27.119	The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.32.001-00.24.34.284	The woman sits gently beside the boy.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.37.801-00.24.40.065	The boy continues to stare down at the comic.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.46.999-00.24.52.185	She looks away and back at him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.56.622-00.24.58.289	He glances up at her for a moment.
1012_Unbreakable_00.24.58.622-00.25.06.004	As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover.
1012_Unbreakable_00.25.55.188-00.26.00.517	The dark haired young man in suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods.
1012_Unbreakable_00.26.05.150-00.26.05.817	The young man grins.
1012_Unbreakable_00.26.06.150-00.26.09.465	Someone limps across the gallery using a cane.
1012_Unbreakable_00.26.12.490-00.26.15.045	Someone turns back to stare at the man.
1012_Unbreakable_00.27.22.563-00.27.27.230	As he does, Someone strides towards the gallery with Someone a few paces behind.
1012_Unbreakable_00.27.27.563-00.27.31.725	Inside, Someone is walking away from the door and doesn't look around.
1012_Unbreakable_00.27.45.061-00.27.47.728	Someone turns.
1012_Unbreakable_00.27.48.061-00.27.48.833	They are sitting in an office.
1012_Unbreakable_00.31.01.623-00.31.03.873	Someone gazes up at his father.
1012_Unbreakable_00.31.14.267-00.31.21.031	Someone looks from Someone to Someone, then gets up and goes.
1012_Unbreakable_00.31.21.053-00.31.24.666	Someone, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at Someone.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.01.346-00.32.09.016	Someone looks around as Someone returns.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.37.157-00.32.40.824	Someone is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.41.157-00.32.43.824	Someone is asleep, lying across him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.44.157-00.32.45.824	His head on Someone's chest.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.46.157-00.32.47.824	One arm flung around him.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.48.157-00.32.50.824	Someone lowers the paper and glances at his son.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.51.157-00.32.55.855	He closes the paper, and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.
1012_Unbreakable_00.32.55.902-00.33.03.260	He opens the door to a walk-in wardrobe, switches on the bare bulb, and feels under some folded jeans on a shelf above his head.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.07.087-00.33.11.753	He removes a piece of gray cloth from which a gun butt protrudes.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.12.087-00.33.24.807	He lays the cloth on his newspaper, unwraps the stubby, black revolver, looks at it, re-wraps it, and replaces it.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.24.846-00.33.29.269	Feeling under the jeans again, he removes a battered folder.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.29.269-00.33.32.617	He opens it and flips through old newspaper clippings about American football.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.41.977-00.33.46.643	A photo of a young Someone in football gear looks out from another story.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.46.977-00.33.54.643	He turns over more clippings, copies of the first stories, pages of sport results, more photos of football matches.
1012_Unbreakable_00.33.54.660-00.34.01.326	The personalities involved disguised by their helmets and face guards, until he comes to a picture of an overturned car.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.01.977-00.34.03.643	He stares at it frowning.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.17.537-00.34.20.203	He looks back at the picture of the car, obviously, taken at night.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.20.537-00.34.25.203	It's lying just beyond a bend in a tree-lined road, upside down in a ditch.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.25.537-00.34.26.815	Its roof crushed.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.30.397-00.34.35.705	He glances across the room, quickly closes, and replaces the folder under his jeans.
1012_Unbreakable_00.34.40.037-00.34.42.055	Someone is outside his door.
1012_Unbreakable_00.35.21.517-00.35.23.183	She looks down.
1012_Unbreakable_00.35.23.517-00.35.26.625	Her face crumbles, and she pushes her fists to her mouth.
1012_Unbreakable_00.36.19.297-00.36.26.890	He watches her turn and start down the stairs before he shuts the door.
1012_Unbreakable_00.36.28.527-00.36.35.780	In a huge football stadium, Someone is on duty holding a walkie-talkie.
1012_Unbreakable_00.36.46.812-00.36.47.738	In a white covered walkway.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.17.969-00.37.23.658	People stroll beside the crowds, cuing to get in.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.30.369-00.37.36.035	Someone brushes past a tall, slim man wearing a pale, sandy green and gray camouflage jacket.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.36.369-00.37.41.474	A few paces further on, he looks back, eyes narrowed.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.41.474-00.37.46.802	When they move on again, Someone, who's wearing a long black leather coat and his usual black gloves, and walking with the help of his stick, glances back too.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.50.356-00.37.52.791	Someone stops at the head of the queue and speaks to another security.
1012_Unbreakable_00.37.57.098-00.38.00.118	The other guards starts frisking the fans.
1012_Unbreakable_00.38.20.331-00.38.22.997	The man with thinning hair and a black beard looks around.
1012_Unbreakable_00.38.23.331-00.38.25.997	People watch the slow moving queue.
1012_Unbreakable_00.38.26.331-00.38.29.997	Someone, the taller of the two, but stooping leaning on his stick.
1012_Unbreakable_00.38.30.331-00.38.37.488	The suspect reaches a break in the metal barriers, steps out of the queue, hand covering his mouth, walks away against the flow of fans.
1012_Unbreakable_00.39.15.841-00.39.18.545	Someone looks at Someone, then away again.
1012_Unbreakable_00.39.29.320-00.39.31.285	Someone grins at Someone.
1012_Unbreakable_00.39.38.451-00.39.41.212	Someone looks away again, and nods.
1012_Unbreakable_00.40.22.814-00.40.24.955	Someone holds up his walkie-talkie.
1012_Unbreakable_00.40.51.883-00.40.54.523	Someone walks along the dark corridor.
1012_Unbreakable_00.40.55.484-00.40.58.515	Someone's glass walking stick lands on the seat of his car.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.16.066-00.41.18.825	The man in the camouflage jacket walks past the car.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.25.876-00.41.29.543	Someone hobbles around the arched colonnade that encircles the stadium.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.29.876-00.41.38.957	Through alternate pools of light and shadows cast by the arches but the man walks fast enough to disappear from sight around the curve of the building.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.44.706-00.41.51.373	Staring around anxiously, Someone spots the man on the other side of the road from the dark brick built stadium.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.51.706-00.41.54.373	The man striding down into the subway.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.54.706-00.41.58.373	Someone waits for a car to pass and crosses the road against the traffic lights.
1012_Unbreakable_00.41.58.706-00.42.02.373	The skirt of his coat flapping open to reveal a purple lining.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.02.706-00.42.06.373	He almost skips across the street in his anxiety.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.09.771-00.42.19.954	Grabbing the handrail to steady himself and silhouetted against the daylight, he stares down the long steep staircase at the man striding into the tiled station.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.23.696-00.42.30.945	Someone watches the man disappear into the station, looks down, and launches himself down the stairs.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.33.166-00.42.39.645	Using his stick and hanging onto the rail, Someone tries to stay balanced, but his feet don't land accurately.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.43.396-00.42.44.063	He slips.
1012_Unbreakable_00.42.44.396-00.42.47.045	His glass stick flies downwards.

1012_Unbreakable_00.43.06.047-00.43.11.714	Looking upside down into the station, he sees the man glance back before vaulting the ticket barrier.
1012_Unbreakable_00.43.12.047-00.43.16.714	As the man's jacket flips up, Someone sees under it a silver gun with a black grip.
1012_Unbreakable_00.43.17.047-00.43.19.685	His eyes flicker and close.
1012_Unbreakable_00.43.22.937-00.43.33.205	A sunny afternoon, a white bus stops on a hill at a suburban street, and Someone gets out still in his security uniform of green jacket and maroon cap and carrying a holdall.

1012_Unbreakable_00.46.04.528-00.46.11.227	He lifts it off the supports, frowning, and lowers it to his chest.
1012_Unbreakable_00.46.11.307-00.46.19.974	As he starts to push it up, his mouth contorts with effort, and a large vein stands out on his forehead from between his eyes up into his scalp.
1012_Unbreakable_00.46.20.307-00.46.24.974	His arms quiver, and his head trembles as he lowers the bar to his chest and pushes it up again.

1012_Unbreakable_00.46.34.345-00.46.37.682	He sits up.
1012_Unbreakable_00.46.44.641-00.46.47.045	Someone puts his head on one side quizzically.
1012_Unbreakable_00.46.50.571-00.46.57.518	He turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar, and Someone walks up to him.

1012_Unbreakable_00.47.40.858-00.47.50.275	Finally, Someone drops the bar back onto the supports.
1012_Unbreakable_00.47.55.718-00.48.00.385	Someone's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip.
1012_Unbreakable_00.48.00.718-00.48.03.385	Even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time.
1012_Unbreakable_00.48.03.718-00.48.05.385	Someone's frowning slightly.

1012_Unbreakable_00.49.17.804-00.49.23.093	Someone drops the bar back in its supports.
1012_Unbreakable_00.49.24.121-00.49.25.787	His left arm flops to the floor.
1012_Unbreakable_00.49.26.121-00.49.29.787	With his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright.

1012_Unbreakable_01.06.37.586-01.06.42.834	The assistant starts pushing again until Someone wrenches the other wheel.

1012_Unbreakable_01.06.52.525-01.06.56.191	He looks down at Someone, who still stares sullenly ahead.
1012_Unbreakable_01.06.56.525-01.07.00.345	They set off again between the racks of comics and related toys.
1012_Unbreakable_01.07.10.790-01.07.14.456	The assistant leaves Someone by the display he is run into.

1012_Unbreakable_01.11.16.339-01.11.19.896	Someone leans against the pillar at the foot of the stairs.
1012_Unbreakable_01.11.58.242-01.12.01.908	She looks at him, one hand holding his coat, the other in his pocket.
1012_Unbreakable_01.12.02.242-01.12.05.605	She nods, turns, and goes.

1012_Unbreakable_01.13.29.537-01.13.34.918	Headlights blaze through the teeming rain.
1012_Unbreakable_01.13.35.251-01.13.37.918	The car stops before a chain link fence.
1012_Unbreakable_01.13.41.841-01.13.46.508	The driver's door opens and a caped and hooded figure walks to the fence.
1012_Unbreakable_01.13.47.341-01.13.59.576	He looks to his left, stands for a moment, a black shape against the headlights, hesitates, then grasps at links above his head and begins to climb.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.01.838-01.14.10.058	A high door swings open, and the caped figure stand in the entrance of a warehouse.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.10.391-01.14.11.058	He looks around.

1012_Unbreakable_01.14.17.391-01.14.27.058	To his left, beyond a set of stairs, two looming shapes appear and become recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, slightly bent and twisted.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.27.391-01.14.32.425	The man walks to the nearer of the two, not badly damaged at the back.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.32.511-01.14.37.178	As he looks up at the length of it, however, he sees that the sides have been smashed open.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.37.511-01.14.40.178	The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered.
1012_Unbreakable_01.14.40.511-01.14.48.178	Seats lean drunkenly, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.05.488-01.15.06.559	Light catches the man's face as he stares up at the wrecked carriage.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.08.055-01.15.13.068	He stands quite still, looking up, grim faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water falling from his hood.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.15.151-01.15.16.470	In the dark, a man is crouching on a force.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.19.194-01.15.20.861	He rises onto his knees.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.21.194-01.15.24.861	As his head comes up, light falls on the face of Someone, aged about 20.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.25.194-01.15.25.861	He looks around.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.26.194-01.15.30.861	The light is coming from a burning car, upside down behind him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.31.194-01.15.36.273	He staggers towards it, stumbling on his knees, crawling.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.36.273-01.15.40.628	A young woman lies in the burning car, unconscious.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.41.795-01.15.43.462	Someone is lying very still.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.43.795-01.15.47.425	Someone grasps the edge of the car door with both hands and pulls.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.50.795-01.15.54.462	He bends down and checks the door catch, which doesn't move.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.54.795-01.15.56.462	Someone's arm is hanging out of the window.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.56.795-01.15.59.462	Someone grabs the edge of the door again and heaves.
1012_Unbreakable_01.15.59.795-01.16.02.985	Beyond him, flames rise up into the night sky.
1012_Unbreakable_01.16.08.053-01.16.16.743	He rips the door from its hinges, bends down, and releases Someone's seat belt.
1012_Unbreakable_01.16.22.444-01.16.35.195	Someone drags Someone from the car, cradles her in his arms, and lays her down gently some yards away.
1012_Unbreakable_01.16.39.145-01.16.44.275	He looks over his shoulder and sees the lights of a pickup truck coming slowly around the bend.
1012_Unbreakable_01.16.46.945-01.16.47.612	He waves frantically.
1012_Unbreakable_01.16.47.945-01.16.50.495	When he looks back, Someone's eyes are open.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.05.255-01.17.06.913	He holds her head, tenderly.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.07.381-01.17.08.624	The truck driver runs to them.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.16.406-01.17.19.073	Someone looks into the man's concerned face, and back at Someone.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.20.806-01.17.24.473	Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.24.806-01.17.28.515	He has a thoughtful expression on his face and doesn't meet the man's eyes.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.35.476-01.17.45.143	Someone rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg still sticking straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it.
1012_Unbreakable_01.17.45.476-01.17.47.329	He picks up the phone.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.02.443-01.18.07.535	Someone looks straight ahead, past the rows of shelving, displaying a huge collection of comics.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.28.693-01.18.33.360	Someone is standing at the top of the stairs above the the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.33.693-01.18.36.360	On either side of him, tall classical stone pillars.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.36.693-01.18.40.360	Directly ahead, the enormous, bright disk of the station clock.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.40.693-01.18.46.360	In the beams of cold silver light from lamps high above in the ceiling, people scurry across the concourse.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.46.693-01.18.52.360	Uniformly grey against the grey floor and walls, Someone descends the stone staircase.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.52.493-01.18.58.741	He stands at the foot of the stairs in a baseball cap and his rain cape, watching humanity ebb and flow.
1012_Unbreakable_01.18.58.803-01.19.01.470	He starts to walk unhurriedly through the crowd.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.01.803-01.19.04.695	A young blonde woman in a bright red jacket bumps into him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.05.966-01.19.07.051	He sees, watching from above, the same woman wearing a different shiny jacket in a jewellery shop.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.07.051-01.19.13.496	She points and the elderly assistant, and while his back is turned, reaches over the counter, takes a bracelet, and drops it into her bag.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.15.781-01.19.22.585	Someone watches her disappearing into the crowd.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.22.918-01.19.24.005	He moves slowly on.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.25.038-01.19.27.705	Other people pass him, some touching him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.28.038-01.19.35.705	He stops in the middle of the concourse, people swirling around him, and holds his left hand out slightly, fingers extended.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.36.038-01.19.42.428	A man in a check shirt worn outside his trousers brushes into Someone's extended hand.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.42.436-01.19.46.406	Once again, he is looking down from high above.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.46.406-01.19.50.506	The man in the check shirt leans out of a pickup and smashes a bottle over the head of a black woman strolling along a city street at night.
1012_Unbreakable_01.19.57.212-01.20.02.014	Frowning, Someone watches the man drain a beer can and drop it into a trash bin.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.03.823-01.20.05.722	A young man in a green shirt kneels by a bed.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.06.602-01.20.09.269	A young woman in a very short party dress is sprawled on the bed.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.09.602-01.20.13.565	She rolls over, unhearing, the dress revealing her thighs.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.14.930-01.20.22.357	The boy watches for a moment, rises, and the girl's leg slips off the bed.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.22.357-01.20.23.211	She is lying on her side, blonde hair spread over an assortment of coats.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.23.211-01.20.24.375	She isn't moving.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.25.930-01.20.28.105	The boy leaves, closing the door behind him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.29.850-01.20.32.517	Someone turns and looks around the station.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.32.850-01.20.36.517	A group of college students files past him, all wearing maroon baseball caps.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.36.850-01.20.43.517	He looks beyond them and sees the young man wearing a green jacket embrace his mother and turn to smile at his father.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.43.850-01.20.50.517	Someone watches and starts to walk backwards, swallowing hard, and glancing at other people as they pass by.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.50.850-01.20.55.605	He backs into a maintenance man in orange overalls pushing a trash bin on wheels.
1012_Unbreakable_01.20.57.660-01.21.01.345	A man opens his front door to the maintenance man now in an orange T-shirt.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.11.639-01.21.14.795	The two men stare at each other through the outer fly screen door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.19.634-01.21.20.415	The maintenance man grabs the door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.21.721-01.21.22.815	He holds the door open.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.24.951-01.21.27.617	Someone sees an image of the house owner sprawled on the basement steps.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.27.951-01.21.30.617	He stares upwards for a moment, his eyes wide.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.30.951-01.21.37.765	Still looking shocked, he gazes around the concourse and spots the maintenance man emptying the trash can on the far side.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.39.701-01.21.44.615	Someone follows the man as he pushes his wheelie bin around a corner and along a dimly lit corridor.
1012_Unbreakable_01.21.44.991-01.21.49.052	A couple of people are lounging listlessly against the wall.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.02.961-01.22.11.495	Someone stands gazing at the door, seeing shadows of people passing back and forth inside through frosted glass panels.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.12.985-01.22.16.192	The door opens and the maintenance man reappears, wearing a cap and with a bag slung across his body.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.21.429-01.22.32.727	The man walks at a steady pace along a dark street lined with cars, and up a long stairway lit by tall bright lamps on alternate sides.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.33.061-01.22.37.025	Someone follows him with the hood of his cape up against the teeming rain.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.45.231-01.22.47.897	At the top of the stairs, he waits and watches.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.48.231-01.22.58.897	The man continues up a street on a gentle incline, where large houses are set back from the road, and turns and walks up the path to a detached house with a mature tree in the front garden.
1012_Unbreakable_01.22.59.231-01.23.12.716	He stops in the porch, looks up and down the street, takes something from beside the porch, and disappears into the shadows around the side of the house.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.13.521-01.23.16.187	Someone drops his head, staring down at the ground.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.16.521-01.23.22.187	The shadow from his hood obscures all his space but a triangle from his nose to his mouth.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.22.521-01.23.25.335	He lifts his head and looks towards the house.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.30.521-01.23.34.187	Two strips of light appear and very slowly widen as a door opens.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.34.521-01.23.42.187	The spreading light falls on mail scattered over a tiled floor, and on clothes strewn on the floor further inside.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.42.521-01.23.45.187	Water drips from a cape onto a pair of shoes.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.45.521-01.23.46.783	Someone stands silhouetted in the doorway.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.46.783-01.23.48.455	Lights are on inside the house.
1012_Unbreakable_01.23.48.465-01.23.54.273	Beyond three open doorways, Someone can see a staircase.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.00.907-01.24.03.573	He stops in the doorway, and slowly turns back.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.03.907-01.24.10.365	He takes a step back into a dark lobby, looking to his left, and reaches forward to open another door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.12.027-01.24.17.600	He looks around and switches on a light.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.17.600-01.24.20.189	The house owner is lying head down on the basement steps, and Someone sees again the maintenance man's violent entry into the house.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.27.668-01.24.34.773	Someone closes the door and moves slowly into the next room, which has half paneled walls.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.35.106-01.24.39.773	He passes a chair at the end of a table, which suggests it's the dining room.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.40.106-01.24.42.773	The next room has easy chairs, a sitting room.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.43.106-01.24.46.773	Light from a television flickers and he glances towards it.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.47.106-01.24.49.355	He stops before moving into the hallway.
1012_Unbreakable_01.24.58.026-01.25.01.925	Someone's shadow grows larger on the wall at the top of the stairs as he climbs them.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.05.086-01.25.07.753	He peers through the crack of a partly open door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.08.086-01.25.19.477	Frowning, he steps forward and pushes it open wider, and flicks on the light.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.20.406-01.25.23.615	He steps into a child's bedroom with pop posters on the wall.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.28.580-01.25.31.925	He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.33.670-01.25.44.189	He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads.
1012_Unbreakable_01.25.48.846-01.25.59.076	He kneels beside the boy pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.06.905-01.26.17.353	The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.21.836-01.26.24.505	He silences the pair, hand out, palm down.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.25.744-01.26.36.723	In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.37.056-01.26.45.723	The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.46.056-01.26.47.723	Her knees are drawn up.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.48.056-01.26.49.723	The gown has slipped partway up her legs.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.50.056-01.26.53.723	Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.54.056-01.26.56.723	Her head lulls on one side.
1012_Unbreakable_01.26.57.056-01.27.01.723	From the other side of the room, Someone looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.04.056-01.27.06.723	He cross to the full length window and parts the curtains.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.07.056-01.27.13.723	After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.14.056-01.27.21.723	He leans on the rail and looks over.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.22.056-01.27.27.237	The maintenance man in orange launches himself at Someone from inside the bedroom.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.29.892-01.27.31.017	Someone is hurled over the balcony.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.31.017-01.27.32.772	He lands on his face in water.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.33.679-01.27.35.031	He lifts his head.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.35.031-01.27.42.275	The black shiny surface on which he is lying begins to crease and sag.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.42.275-01.27.47.086	Water forms an ever larger pool around him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.47.419-01.27.52.086	He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.52.419-01.27.57.086	Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself.
1012_Unbreakable_01.27.57.419-01.28.01.086	More ridges ahead and to his right do the same.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.01.419-01.28.06.175	Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.09.869-01.28.16.375	From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.17.139-01.28.24.806	Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.25.139-01.28.28.806	His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.29.139-01.28.33.806	High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.34.139-01.28.40.806	Darkness and light alternate under the water as Someone struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.41.139-01.28.45.806	Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.46.139-01.28.50.806	Someone reaches for it, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it.
1012_Unbreakable_01.28.51.139-01.28.55.135	Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.00.762-01.29.08.249	Someone struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.08.582-01.29.18.249	The pole slides away, and Someone hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.18.582-01.29.24.249	The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.24.582-01.29.27.249	The pole is lying on the ground between them.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.27.582-01.29.29.445	Someone stands and looks at them.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.36.742-01.29.42.409	Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.42.742-01.29.49.409	Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.49.742-01.29.55.409	Someone closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand.
1012_Unbreakable_01.29.55.742-01.30.00.409	The man tears at the choking arm, and slams Someone back into the bedroom wall.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.00.742-01.30.03.409	Someone's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.03.742-01.30.07.151	The man tries to throw him off, but Someone squeezes his throat relentlessly.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.08.596-01.30.14.263	The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.14.596-01.30.19.145	He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting Someone, still trying to throw him off.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.19.776-01.30.23.443	They reel across the room and he smashes Someone into the wall again.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.23.776-01.30.32.485	He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.34.156-01.30.36.545	He rises off balance and Someone drags him back down.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.47.594-01.30.52.777	He sinks to the floor and Someone tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck.
1012_Unbreakable_01.30.52.777-01.31.00.448	Someone throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.00.448-01.31.11.242	Someone crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.11.242-01.31.13.581	When they are free, her arms flop down.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.13.581-01.31.15.328	Someone steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.15.869-01.31.20.045	He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.22.358-01.31.26.586	Someone gently opens a closet door.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.36.774-01.31.44.441	Someone's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.44.774-01.31.50.441	She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as Someone carries her up the staircase.
1012_Unbreakable_01.31.50.774-01.32.06.441	She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.32.06.774-01.32.23.223	He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.
1012_Unbreakable_01.32.23.304-01.32.25.971	Her eyes follow him around the room.
1012_Unbreakable_01.32.26.304-01.32.29.971	Her head turns to him as he gets into bed beside her.

1012_Unbreakable_01.32.56.744-01.32.59.735	Her eyes close.
1012_Unbreakable_01.33.05.534-01.33.11.095	Someone opens her eyes again as Someone closes his, and his face relaxes.

1012_Unbreakable_01.34.20.311-01.34.28.347	Someone unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full.
1012_Unbreakable_01.34.29.081-01.34.33.747	He replaces the cap and stands to remove the carton from the table.
1012_Unbreakable_01.34.34.081-01.34.43.178	He sits again, staring at the glass.
1012_Unbreakable_01.34.43.178-01.34.48.747	The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him.
1012_Unbreakable_01.34.58.081-01.35.03.747	Someone looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story.

1012_Unbreakable_01.35.07.081-01.35.13.747	Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw.

1012_Unbreakable_01.35.33.457-01.35.42.364	Someone puts a finger to his lips, and Someone nods and wipes away a tear.
1012_Unbreakable_01.35.43.627-01.35.48.573	Someone glances down, then looks up and gives Someone a smile.
1012_Unbreakable_01.35.49.934-01.36.01.641	At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests.

1012_Unbreakable_01.38.06.801-01.38.08.926	He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper.
1012_Unbreakable_01.38.09.260-01.38.14.015	He looks at it and turns it round, showing Someone the drawing of the hero in the cape.

1012_Unbreakable_01.38.39.512-01.38.50.855	Slowly, looking into Someone's eyes, he holds out his gloved hand, and, equally slowly, Someone takes it and squeezes.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.00.47.519-00.00.49.479	A few flakes of snow gently flutter out of a night sky past a Christmas Tree made of fairy lights atop an establishment advertising itself as O'Hara's Pub.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.01.13.260-00.01.17.760	A few people wander down the street, clutching gifts for their loved ones.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.01.39.164-00.01.43.764	At the far end of the bar, a seedy, unshaven man in his late 40s, wearing Someone costume, sits alone, enjoying two glasses of an entirely different kind of spirit.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.03.25.690-00.03.30.243	At the top one of the children stares in wonder at the lavage Someone's grotto that's been constructed.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.03.33.860-00.03.50.988	In the grotto dressed as an elf hands a photo of a girl and Someone to her mother.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.03.53.346-00.03.57.880	Someone, at work

1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.04.570-00.04.08.045	Someone still looks seedy but has at least bothered to put his white beard on.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.21.614-00.04.23.282	He shoves the boy away.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.31.770-00.04.38.554	Little later, Someone wets himself as his little helper wanders over.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.39.405-00.04.51.127	Someone pulls down his beard and swigs from a bottle of grog, then examines his pants.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.52.239-00.04.54.425	His little helper shakes his head despairingly.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.04.55.979-00.05.06.699	The security guard says farewell to the last shoppers.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.05.29.639-00.05.33.306	As Someone shuffles off, the guard keys a code into an alarm system.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.05.38.639-00.05.50.770	Up in the grotto, three snowmen sit behind statues of Someone and the baby Someone in his crib.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.05.52.356-00.05.56.642	The smallest snowman suddenly jumps up, but after a quick look to see the coast is clear, runs off, knocking people over in the process.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.05.58.589-00.06.04.018	The snowman slides down between the escalators as the alarm system continues its arming countdown.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.04.398-00.06.08.298	He crashes into a display at the bottom and trots up to run through the shop.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.12.247-00.06.13.470	The snowman pulls the arm off of a mannequin as he goes.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.14.302-00.06.18.488	He uses the arm to reach up and switch off the alarm before it can ON.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.18.585-00.06.22.669	The snowman pulls his head off, revealing Someone's profusely sweating little helper.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.23.169-00.06.28.836	Now in regular clothes, Someone's little helper opens a back door and finds Someone surrounded by empty beer cans.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.28.881-00.06.30.337	The elf shakes his head sadly.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.06.58.599-00.07.04.490	On the shop floor, his little helper helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are detailed on a list.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.05.659-00.07.13.364	He checks his list while eyeing a string of pearls in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to smash it open.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.14.529-00.07.18.765	Later he joins Someone in the vault, and finds Someone peering through the hole he drilled.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.27.069-00.07.27.585	Someone uses a chisel.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.30.006-00.07.32.804	He opens the safe and wards of notes spil out onto the floor.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.35.845-00.07.40.718	An oriental woman sits at the wheel of a van as Someone and his little helper climb in the back with their booty.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.42.803-00.07.43.303	She turns to the elf.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.46.170-00.07.49.228	The woman puts her foot on the accelerator, and the van speeds off throwing Someone and the elf backwards.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.07.52.620-00.08.08.046	Later Someone, who in less seasonal times goes by the name of Someone, dances with Someone, the elf in a bar.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.08.08.046-00.08.13.455	Someone puts down Someone on a bar stool by the counter.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.08.13.455-00.08.16.037	and sits down beside him.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.08.22.177-00.08.28.909	The barmaid serves them.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.08.31.519-00.08.34.576	People raise their glasses.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.08.36.529-00.08.40.143	They down their drinks and set the glasses back down on the counter.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.09.29.989-00.09.32.319	Someone gives Someone a dubious look.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.04.179-00.10.09.299	Someone looks expectantly at Someone, who considers, and then turns to the barmaid.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.11.829-00.10.13.287	He turns back to Someone with a half smile.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.18.448-00.10.20.213	He looks down doubtfully at his empty glass.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.25.095-00.10.30.284	 A plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women adorn the sand.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.34.809-00.10.40.495	Someone, now in a Hawaiian shirt, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.40.999-00.10.48.602	He puts them under the counter and pours a generous measure of vodka into a tumbler.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.49.673-00.10.53.979	As he does so, an irate man clutching a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.10.55.079-00.10.55.715	Someone slurps at the drink.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.02.719-00.11.10.820	The barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.11.149-00.11.13.797	Someone throws a vodka bottle at the barman.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.13.797-00.11.16.596	And misses it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.16.596-00.11.19.749	The barman leaps over the counter, and Someone runs for it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.23.149-00.11.23.605	Someone does as suggested.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.24.269-00.11.29.395	Sometime later he is sitting alone having a good leech at some more bikini clad lovelies playing volleyball.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.33.699-00.11.41.455	He licks his lips as he admires their well-toned backsides and sips from a bottle of beer.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.44.019-00.11.55.476	The next morning, Someone is asleep on his bed in a not-so- awful, not-so-great apartment.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.11.58.161-00.12.07.579	He reaches over to the clock radio which is surrounded by last night's empties and fumbles for the off button, unable to find it he rips it out of its socket.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.08.578-00.12.23.745	Having smashed the clock and several empties, he sits down on the bed, and, in need of refreshment, drinks from a half-full bottle with a cigarette end floating about it in.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.24.361-00.12.28.414	A smart convertible pulls up at a car valeting serviced by the beach.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.28.414-00.12.34.059	Someone strolls up as the driver hands over the keys.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.34.059-00.12.42.693	The young guy from the valet service drives off with the convertible and Someone walks over to a board holding the car keys.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.42.693-00.12.49.653	He looks around then picks up several of the keys.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.12.52.703-00.13.01.737	He saunters through the parking lot pressing the remotes and cars flash and unlock.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.01.858-00.13.10.841	Someone tosses the keys away nonchalantly and keeps unlocking.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.14.208-00.13.21.535	He walks up to one of the cars he is just unlocked, then presses another remote and turns to see a blue sports convertible.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.22.715-00.13.24.916	His eyes brighten and he goes for that.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.24.916-00.13.32.699	He climbs in and, opening the glove compartment, he takes out the tax disk and reads the address on it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.34.135-00.13.41.268	He replaces the disk, starts engine, and drives away.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.43.328-00.13.45.995	The car is parked outside a grand mansion with a pillared entranceway.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.46.328-00.13.51.295	Inside, Someone climbs an elegant marble staircase toward a balustrated balcony.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.13.56.514-00.14.04.575	Upstairs, in a smart kitchen, he drinks milk from the bottle, then replaces it in the well-stocked fridge.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.14.05.442-00.14.11.475	He munches on a chicken leg and sits on the toilet.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.14.12.707-00.14.16.608	Later he fiddles with the handle of the un-flushing toilet.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.14.17.458-00.14.20.925	He stands up and looks at it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.14.21.345-00.14.29.490	He tosses the chicken leg down the pan as he saunters aimlessly down the hallway, he tips oil paintings off the wall.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.14.33.558-00.14.37.686	On a wood panelled wall he sees a large portrait of a boy with dark hair.

1017_Bad_Santa_00.48.00.945-00.48.03.279	Someone opens the door to a balding man.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.48.08.134-00.48.08.801	He proffers his hand.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.48.09.295-00.48.10.995	Someone glances at the kid.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.48.25.785-00.48.27.405	He hands Someone some paperwork.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.49.11.177-00.49.25.875	As Someone nods off in front of the TV, Someone is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.49.31.358-00.49.39.111	Still wearing his festive red cap, Someone energetically humps Someone, the barmaid up against the side of the hot tub putting in smokes and foam.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.49.42.466-00.49.47.277	Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.49.49.855-00.49.55.719	They sit on the sofa together.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.50.00.925-00.50.06.197	He hands her her glass, and they each take a swig of their respective drinks.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.50.46.055-00.50.48.035	She sits back and smiles.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.50.58.597-00.51.07.485	She laughs to herself, and he nods off.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.08.695-00.51.10.362	She looks a little bit disappointed.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.10.695-00.51.18.353	Later Someone accompanies her to the front door and sees her out.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.25.796-00.51.29.502	She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.29.712-00.51.32.337	She heads off into the night.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.33.153-00.51.41.447	Someone shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kids advent calendar is lying.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.44.045-00.51.48.492	He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.51.48.492-00.51.58.103	He then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.03.836-00.52.14.332	Calendar ruined, chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.14.332-00.52.24.625	He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, which is about a quarter.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.27.326-00.52.33.321	He belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.33.655-00.52.40.152	The next morning he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.46.005-00.52.48.848	The kid's hand is covered in blood.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.52.50.557-00.52.55.658	Someone follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.04.746-00.53.07.890	He pours vodka on the cut.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.15.380-00.53.21.194	Someone turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.33.137-00.53.34.981	Someone looks slightly uneasy.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.35.315-00.53.40.825	Then he spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.44.274-00.53.48.799	Later that morning, Someone drives the BMW into the deserted car park.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.48.895-00.53.52.151	Someone is standing beside a green van waiting for him.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.52.592-00.53.58.245	They open the back of the van, and Someone irritably hands Someone an empty Someone sack.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.53.59.396-00.54.00.581	Someone shakes his head.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.02.424-00.54.04.383	He puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.07.918-00.54.12.585	The gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, people head for the mall.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.13.584-00.54.16.515	Outside a door, a security guard is on duty.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.24.706-00.54.29.229	The tall, blonde security guard checks his watch.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.38.160-00.54.48.379	In the back room Someone puts the sack down, and Someone points to an air conditioning vent.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.49.448-00.54.51.559	Someone takes the cover off the vent and clamors into the duct.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.53.302-00.54.55.535	Clutching a torch, he crawls along it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.54.56.056-00.54.57.629	A man in an office looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.01.541-00.55.03.842	Another woman working at her desk looks up, as does a woman at the next desk.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.07.406-00.55.10.407	The woman turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and gets on with her work.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.10.962-00.55.15.991	Someone arrives at a vent and looks out into a security office full of monitors.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.18.727-00.55.21.574	He looks at the equipment and makes some notes on a pad.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.22.694-00.55.23.933	Someone is having a pedicure.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.27.173-00.55.30.283	He answers his phone.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.55.58.894-00.56.01.561	Someone, the kid's dad, is in prison.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.56.01.894-00.56.06.585	Someone walks into the prison visitors room where balding, bespectacled Someone is sitting.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.56.28.704-00.56.30.465	Someone nods his head and gets up.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.56.35.874-00.56.38.438	Someone looks confused.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.56.40.659-00.56.44.758	Someone cooks for the kid and Someone.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.56.56.404-00.56.58.015	He serves it up.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.05.794-00.57.07.605	He spoons a dollop onto it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.19.314-00.57.22.265	He turns back to the stove and flips the bologna.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.27.324-00.57.28.991	The kid heads off to get it.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.29.324-00.57.34.665	Someone serves up a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself and puts it on the breakfast bar.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.40.170-00.57.42.297	The kid hands it to him.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.45.374-00.57.49.041	He hands it back to the kid who struggles to open the appropriate door.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.49.374-00.57.53.975	Rather as if someone might have already opened it and then stuck it back down with a bit too much adhesive.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.57.55.054-00.57.59.663	Someone watches out of the corner of his eye as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.58.09.350-00.58.14.087	Someone is with Someone, who's mixing himself a dose of Fibracell stool softener.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.58.56.374-00.58.57.445	Someone winces.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.00.674-00.59.02.975	Someone slurps his stool softener and grimaces.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.05.190-00.59.13.197	The bus pulls up outside the mall and the skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.14.234-00.59.16.901	The kid sees them and hesitates for a moment.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.17.234-00.59.19.275	Then, eyes front, keeps walking down the street.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.20.814-00.59.23.795	The skate rats follow in, close behind him, their interest clearly malicious.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.26.681-00.59.30.407	They get him and they grot him.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.34.611-00.59.39.875	The boy wanders off and Someone scratches his own ass.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.45.231-00.59.46.844	The kid appears, his pants around his armpits.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.49.044-00.59.50.711	Someone heads off.
1017_Bad_Santa_00.59.51.044-00.59.54.283	Someone looks at the kid.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.00.17.094-01.00.23.671	Someone stares incredulously at the kid for a moment then shakes his head.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.00.59.549-01.01.00.980	The kid just stares at him.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.01.08.735-01.01.12.401	The kid walks away still with his underpants up around his armpits.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.01.12.904-01.01.15.625	Someone watches him go with a doleful expression.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.01.17.954-01.01.24.125	Someone turns back to Someone who, for an elf, is staring at him in a very deadpan way.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.01.28.644-01.01.32.195	Someone is the next in line.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.01.36.754-01.01.41.305	People in a bar.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.02.23.583-01.02.24.765	Someone shifts uneasily.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.02.31.849-01.02.37.521	Someone leans forward.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.03.03.273-01.03.06.425	Someone glances at Someone and rubs his chin thoughtfully.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.03.40.770-01.03.43.660	Someone gets up from the table and goes.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.03.43.993-01.03.45.575	People regard each other.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.18.463-01.04.23.130	Someone resignedly rests his head on his hand while Someone slips into a brooding silence.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.23.463-01.04.27.998	The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers has formed at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.29.866-01.04.34.342	A semi-comatose Someone is on his way as he lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.38.134-01.04.42.716	Someone, back in elf guise, is trying to calm the kids.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.44.543-01.04.50.048	At the top of the escalator, Someone drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, broken bottle still in hand.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.50.956-01.04.58.384	Someone shakes his head as Someone makes his way into the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.04.59.088-01.05.05.410	In his state of extreme over-refreshment, he keels over and collapses on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.05.773-01.05.12.440	The kids and moms gasp as Someone rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.12.773-01.05.13.440	He is falling on his back.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.13.773-01.05.15.440	He sees a second donkey going over.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.15.773-01.05.19.440	He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.19.773-01.05.25.440	He then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a fine display of drunken violence.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.05.25.773-01.05.36.139	The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as Someone strides up.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.06.16.803-01.06.17.395	Someone drops Someone.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.06.38.853-01.06.40.831	Someone shoves Someone contemptuously in the leg and marches off.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.06.43.359-01.06.44.516	and drags Someone away.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.06.51.593-01.06.53.285	Later on, Someone is back at the kid's house in the garage.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.06.54.993-01.07.04.325	He sits in Someone's BMW with the engine running, having first run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window in order to commit a seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.08.677-01.07.12.325	The kid walks into the garage and sees him.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.13.063-01.07.16.729	Someone's head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.17.063-01.07.21.815	The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.23.513-01.07.24.525	Someone moves slightly.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.35.913-01.07.38.221	Someone raises his head a little and looks at the kid.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.49.123-01.07.52.383	The kid turns and makes to go out of the garage.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.07.56.683-01.08.00.805	Someone winds the driver's window down and hands the kid a letter.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.16.962-01.08.18.195	He sees the kid has got a black eye.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.22.830-01.08.29.759	Later, Someone is smashing into the chief skaterat's face.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.30.292-01.08.36.345	He turns to the rest of the gang.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.36.772-01.08.39.625	Two other kids, on bikes, watch astounded as Someone administers the festive beating.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.40.855-01.08.45.522	Back at the mall, people are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.08.48.542-01.08.55.365	Someone gets changed out of his elf gear while Someone, in contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.09.26.942-01.09.30.575	Someone looks incredulously at Someone who drags on a fag.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.09.38.041-01.09.38.992	In a boxing occa.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.09.50.992-01.09.53.833	He is talking to the kid.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.10.01.891-01.10.03.960	Someone is his opponent.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.10.11.296-01.10.12.927	Someone looks him over.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.10.55.129-01.10.58.468	The kid steps forward and kicks Someone in the crotch, doubling him up.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.04.774-01.11.09.093	He punches the kid low.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.11.140-01.11.14.677	He whacks Someone in the balls too.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.16.241-01.11.22.749	He hits Someone in the nuts and all three combatants lie, writhing in agony, on the canvas.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.23.557-01.11.26.026	Someone turns to the kid.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.30.438-01.11.36.130	They kick at each other.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.38.602-01.11.49.310	That night, Someone has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when people come in, they see her.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.11.49.310-01.11.58.399	Someone lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.01.342-01.12.06.454	They walk a little closer.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.06.802-01.12.08.215	Someone goes over to her.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.12.097-01.12.15.359	Someone looks on anxiously as Someone bends over Someone.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.20.582-01.12.23.313	Someone looks round at Someone.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.25.812-01.12.30.479	He holds his hand in front of her mouth then puts his head to her chest to listen for a heartbeat.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.30.812-01.12.33.547	Someone suddenly comes to.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.40.922-01.12.44.589	Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.44.922-01.12.46.589	On it lies odd discarded clothes.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.46.922-01.12.50.528	Nearby, Someone lies on her back in her bra and jeans.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.50.922-01.12.53.237	A bare-chested Someone sits astride her, wearing his jeans and Someone hat.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.53.237-01.12.57.433	He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.12.58.803-01.13.01.382	He then leans forward and kisses her.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.01.972-01.13.06.265	He kisses his way back down her body and grips her pants between his teeth and pulls on them.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.12.781-01.13.15.464	As he does so, the kid comes in through the door.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.30.602-01.13.34.269	He hands Someone a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon round it.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.34.602-01.13.35.875	Mystified, Someone looks at it.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.43.892-01.13.47.327	He holds up his injured hand.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.13.54.972-01.13.56.385	Someone looks moved.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.10.052-01.14.12.195	She props herself up on her elbows.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.19.107-01.14.19.774	Someone stares at the pickle.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.21.852-01.14.23.355	Someone smiles.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.27.602-01.14.28.785	He stares at her.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.34.612-01.14.36.425	He looks at her and nods to himself.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.42.852-01.14.44.519	He smiles and shrugs.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.14.44.852-01.14.51.999	The next morning, Someone is back in his Someone gear and rooting around in the fridge in the kitchen when the kid runs in.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.15.03.004-01.15.04.989	Someone takes the report card.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.15.20.974-01.15.23.913	Someone puts the report card down.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.15.41.972-01.15.43.365	Someone stops buttering toast.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.15.47.829-01.15.49.389	Someone looks down sadly.
1017_Bad_Santa_01.15.50.194-01.15.50.825	Someone angrily throws down his knife.

2004_Juno_01.01.38.793-01.01.41.161	Someone notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way.
2004_Juno_01.01.44.325-01.01.46.160	She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.
2004_Juno_01.01.57.581-01.01.58.183	We see Someone the teacher talking to some science kids in the background.

2004_Juno_01.15.23.458-01.15.25.037	After a beat, she begins to gather herself.
2004_Juno_01.15.26.433-01.15.35.692	She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Someone receipt.
2004_Juno_01.15.38.137-01.15.41.503	She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something.
2004_Juno_01.15.47.566-01.15.48.976	Inside, we see Someone sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine.
2004_Juno_01.15.48.977-01.15.50.979	Someone takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in.
2004_Juno_01.15.51.132-01.15.54.528	After a beat, Someone comes down the stairs to join her.

2004_Juno_01.16.51.601-01.16.53.466	He squints and sees Someone pulling away in the van.
2004_Juno_01.16.59.221-01.16.59.677	He holds it up.
2004_Juno_01.16.59.677-01.16.59.926	We can see there's WRITING on the back.
2004_Juno_01.16.59.926-01.17.04.594	Someone takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it.
2004_Juno_01.17.06.162-01.17.09.006	A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.
2004_Juno_01.17.15.597-01.17.31.937	Someone parks her car and walks up to her house.
2004_Juno_01.17.33.450-01.17.38.484	She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it.
2004_Juno_01.17.38.651-01.17.48.926	She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it.
2004_Juno_01.17.51.118-01.17.52.401	Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Someone's weight loss shakes.

2004_Juno_01.23.54.509-01.23.58.606	Someone lets out a genuine shriek of pain.
2004_Juno_01.25.43.296-01.25.46.076	The doctor reveals Someone's BABY BOY above the sheet.
2004_Juno_01.25.48.230-01.25.50.760	Someone looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter.
2004_Juno_01.25.51.744-01.25.54.298	and she passes out.
2004_Juno_01.25.54.713-01.25.56.370	Someone is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track.
2004_Juno_01.25.56.516-01.25.57.028	There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers.
2004_Juno_01.25.57.192-01.25.57.256	As Someone approaches the tape, his envious teammate Someone looks on.
2004_Juno_01.25.57.344-01.25.57.917	The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer.
2004_Juno_01.25.58.079-01.25.59.230	Someone breaks the tape, winning the race.
2004_Juno_01.25.59.382-01.26.02.926	Someone looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Someone.

2004_Juno_01.27.44.475-01.27.48.627	The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.
2004_Juno_01.28.01.948-01.28.07.320	A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.
2004_Juno_01.29.02.252-01.29.02.947	It looks like it was handwritten on the back of Someone bill.
2004_Juno_01.29.07.177-01.29.10.700	We move to the door and get a view of Someone's bedroom.
2004_Juno_01.29.12.129-01.29.14.494	We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby.
2004_Juno_01.29.14.665-01.29.15.542	For the first time ever, Someone looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy.
2004_Juno_01.29.15.704-01.29.16.090	There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed.
2004_Juno_01.29.16.274-01.29.17.178	Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment.
2004_Juno_01.29.24.533-01.29.29.191	It's a sparkling summer afternoon.
2004_Juno_01.29.32.166-01.29.33.012	She waves goodbye to Someone, who is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS.
2004_Juno_01.29.33.184-01.29.33.651	She looks happy, but older.
2004_Juno_01.29.33.835-01.29.34.442	She looks almost as happy with her dogs as Someone looked with her baby.
2004_Juno_01.29.35.128-01.29.36.180	Someone wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage.
2004_Juno_01.29.36.347-01.29.37.776	She is obviously not pregnant anymore.
2004_Juno_01.29.37.916-01.29.39.224	Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag.

2004_Juno_01.30.11.445-01.30.14.489	Someone bikes up to find Someone sitting on the stoop.

2004_Juno_01.30.17.753-01.30.20.920	She sits across from Someone and pulls the pick out of the strings.
2004_Juno_01.30.20.996-01.30.21.650	Someone nods.
2004_Juno_01.30.37.154-01.30.42.154	She and Someone exchange glances as they play.
2004_Juno_01.30.43.490-01.30.52.593	Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity.
2004_Juno_01.30.53.369-01.31.02.676	They smile ambiguously.
2004_Juno_01.32.12.216-01.32.14.725	Someone leans over and kisses Someone on the cheek.
2004_Juno_01.32.14.865-01.32.17.828	As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.16.306-00.01.19.869	Someone puts down his shopping bags and moves to her.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.19.869-00.01.24.500	He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.26.939-00.01.31.087	The woman smiles for the first time.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.38.371-00.01.43.192	She hands him the wrapped child.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.46.897-00.01.49.054	The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.49.054-00.01.50.426	The woman can't see her baby anymore.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.52.151-00.01.54.301	She watches Dr. 
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.51.014-00.01.52.778	Someone as he looks down and examines her child.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.55.887-00.01.56.708	The doctor finally glances up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.56.708-00.01.57.200	He looks shaken.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.57.200-00.01.59.004	He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second.
2012_Unbreakable_00.01.59.332-00.02.00.316	A chill goes through her body.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.00.316-00.02.02.121	He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.02.121-00.02.03.600	His hard stare unsettles the women.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.03.600-00.02.07.311	The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.15.635-00.02.16.194	Everyone becomes very still.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.16.194-00.02.17.173	The mother looks like she stopped breathing.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.20.292-00.02.20.867	The BABY SCREAMS. 
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.23.490-00.02.25.474	The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.08.432-00.02.09.776	He looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in.
2012_Unbreakable_00.02.31.437-00.02.33.908	Someone turns back to the mother.
2012_Unbreakable_00.05.10.050-00.05.16.364	The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.
2012_Unbreakable_00.05.16.364-00.05.22.309	Someone pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.19.114-00.06.22.527	Someone waits till the opposing train passes.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.28.918-00.06.31.119	The woman goes back to her magazine.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.42.818-00.06.46.796	Someone looks up from her Sports Illustrated.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.46.801-00.06.48.058	Her striking blue eyes gaze at Someone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.48.101-00.06.49.862	She holds up her hand.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.49.862-00.06.52.328	Taps the diamond ring on her finger.
2012_Unbreakable_00.06.57.541-00.07.01.014	An awkward silence.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.14.724-00.07.17.647	Someone gets up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.17.695-00.07.20.830	She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.20.830-00.07.22.876	She starts to the back of the car.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.22.876-00.07.24.964	Someone sits alone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.25.528-00.07.27.620	He looks like he is drowning, but there's no water.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.42.747-00.07.44.391	He feels a stare.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.38.604-00.07.41.914	He glances up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.44.313-00.07.47.986	The little girl spies on him from between the seats.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.48.857-00.07.55.715	Someone leans towards the window to avoid eye contact.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.28.288-00.07.33.901	His hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.34.043-00.07.37.169	He puts it back on.
2012_Unbreakable_00.07.56.964-00.08.04.581	The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.07.581-00.08.11.432	Someone's head bounces lightly against the window.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.11.432-00.08.14.754	The shaking of the glass never allows Someone's eyes to completely close.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.14.754-00.08.17.940	He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.17.940-00.08.19.685	He looks out the window.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.20.731-00.08.25.213	The scenery blurs as it flies by.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.25.213-00.08.26.713	Someone turns.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.27.784-00.08.31.838	Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.36.569-00.08.37.676	The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.38.183-00.08.40.094	The train goes faster.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.32.613-00.08.35.149	Someone's eyes move to the seat in front of him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.35.893-00.08.37.083	The little girl is no longer watching him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.39.166-00.08.41.639	Someone LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.41.639-00.08.42.901	He sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.53.631-00.08.55.882	A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.55.882-00.08.56.894	His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.56.894-00.08.58.520	He changes channels with a remote control.
2012_Unbreakable_00.08.58.742-00.09.07.402	He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.13.787-00.09.17.039	He stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.20.394-00.09.23.796	His knees come forward as he flips over.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.23.796-00.09.26.453	He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.26.453-00.09.27.593	Someone gazes at the television screen.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.29.215-00.09.30.929	A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.31.912-00.09.33.934	Two trains are tangled like snakes.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.37.690-00.09.46.419	Someone gets up and moves to a small table with a phone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.46.419-00.09.48.516	Next to the phone is a notepad.
2012_Unbreakable_00.09.51.963-00.09.59.453	WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER.
2012_Unbreakable_00.11.59.871-00.12.13.242	About a dozen people are on specialized weight machines.
2012_Unbreakable_00.12.33.929-00.12.37.669	The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.
2012_Unbreakable_00.12.38.470-00.12.41.151	Someone looks away.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.25.669-00.17.27.114	The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.27.114-00.17.27.539	Her left hand keeps typing.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.27.539-00.17.27.879	She never looks up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.45.298-00.17.47.420	Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.47.420-00.17.49.047	Someone stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.49.047-00.17.50.153	He stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.50.153-00.17.50.744	The poncho almost touches the ground.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.50.744-00.17.51.447	The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.51.447-00.17.52.138	We can barely see Someone's face under the hood.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.52.518-00.17.55.521	There is a football game in progress on the enormous field.
2012_Unbreakable_00.17.55.521-00.17.57.618	The players seem unusually small.
2012_Unbreakable_00.18.04.740-00.18.11.776	Someone steps out into the rain.
2012_Unbreakable_00.18.27.645-00.18.29.536	Someone turns on the bench.
2012_Unbreakable_00.18.50.095-00.18.53.871	The room is still.
2012_Unbreakable_00.19.18.928-00.19.23.144	They both stand awkwardly for a moment.
2012_Unbreakable_00.19.37.471-00.19.43.448	Someone tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question.
2012_Unbreakable_00.21.53.686-00.21.58.942	Someone just sits staring at the dark television screen.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.01.110-00.22.02.872	Someone's face is tense.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.02.872-00.22.04.019	Unyielding.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.05.930-00.22.21.541	Someone's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.21.965-00.22.26.410	Someone's eyes move from the television to his mother.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.26.410-00.22.28.478	He sees the emotion in her face.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.28.478-00.22.32.310	Neither says anything for a while.
2012_Unbreakable_00.22.42.623-00.22.46.864	Someone thinks it over.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.00.263-00.23.03.263	Someone looks at his mother with disbelief.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.21.749-00.23.24.548	Someone walks across the playground.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.24.548-00.23.28.115	He is very wary of the other children running about him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.28.115-00.23.35.707	He walks towards the bench with the present on it.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.35.707-00.23.39.831	Takes a seat.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.39.831-00.23.41.330	Puts the package on his lap.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.41.330-00.23.41.935	It's flat.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.41.935-00.23.42.599	The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.42.599-00.23.44.389	He undoes the white bow.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.44.548-00.23.48.158	He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together.
2012_Unbreakable_00.23.48.158-00.23.55.941	He unfolds the paper.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.03.965-00.24.13.568	Someone stares down at the single comic book in his lap.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.28.838-00.24.31.682	He feels the shadow of his mother.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.33.392-00.24.36.740	She takes a seat next to him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.31.682-00.24.33.392	Someone looks to his mother.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.56.253-00.24.58.123	His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a moment.
2012_Unbreakable_00.24.58.123-00.25.00.115	He looks back down at his lap.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.00.115-00.25.00.615	He opens the first page.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.04.132-00.25.05.962	Two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.05.962-00.25.07.007	One figure is extremely muscular with a mask.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.07.007-00.25.07.922	The other is half human, half animal.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.08.771-00.25.11.395	Someone glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the sketch.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.56.367-00.25.59.069	The business man rubs his face.
2012_Unbreakable_00.25.59.069-00.26.01.495	Gazes at the sketch.
2012_Unbreakable_00.26.05.418-00.26.09.329	Someone starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.
2012_Unbreakable_00.26.09.329-00.26.12.758	Someone jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops.
2012_Unbreakable_00.26.12.758-00.26.16.227	He turns.
2012_Unbreakable_00.26.26.429-00.26.31.321	Someone starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.10.586-00.27.12.922	Someone's eyes pierce through the shaken man.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.13.527-00.27.15.537	Someone points at the sketch.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.15.537-00.27.17.767	Someone turns and faces the customers for the first time.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.37.572-00.27.44.047	Someone stands with Someone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.45.170-00.27.47.019	Someone just stands staring for the longest time.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.47.019-00.27.48.446	He walks closer to them.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.48.779-00.27.51.181	When Someone speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.
2012_Unbreakable_00.27.51.181-00.27.53.685	Someone nods.
2012_Unbreakable_00.28.05.636-00.28.08.404	Someone looks shaken.
2012_Unbreakable_00.28.09.402-00.28.13.065	Someone gazes at Someone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.30.34.459-00.30.41.797	Someone points at the framed comic sketches.
2012_Unbreakable_00.28.17.328-00.28.20.924	Someone shakes his head.
2012_Unbreakable_00.28.27.360-00.28.30.266	He smiles out of frustration.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.16.644-00.32.21.948	Someone watches Someone walk towards the front door.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.37.252-00.34.37.457	Someone watches through the window as Someone takes Someone's hand as they cross the street.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.37.457-00.34.37.607	Someone gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.33.913-00.32.37.347	Someone sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.40.730-00.32.45.155	Someone is asleep horizontally with his legs over Someone's legs.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.50.623-00.32.54.192	Someone slides out from under his son's legs.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.54.192-00.32.57.064	Someone stirs but doesn't wake up.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.57.064-00.32.58.165	Someone moves to the darkness of the corner of the room.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.58.165-00.32.59.634	He opens a closet door.
2012_Unbreakable_00.32.59.634-00.33.01.466	A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as Someone yanks a chain.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.01.466-00.33.01.979	Someone steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T FALL ON Someone.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.01.979-00.33.02.479	There's just enough room to stand and look around.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.02.569-00.33.06.993	Someone stretches as he feels on the top shelf.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.06.993-00.33.10.301	His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.10.301-00.33.14.564	He unwraps it.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.14.564-00.33.15.736	It's a handgun.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.15.736-00.33.22.244	He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.22.244-00.33.23.766	He stretches even more.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.23.766-00.33.25.184	Reaches farther back.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.25.600-00.33.31.230	He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.31.230-00.33.35.618	He opens the folder to reveal a young Someone in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.42.458-00.33.48.080	Someone flips through the top clippings all are images and stories of Someone and football.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.48.080-00.33.53.121	He turns the pile over.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.53.121-00.33.56.222	Goes to the last clipping.
2012_Unbreakable_00.33.56.222-00.34.00.094	This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.06.113-00.34.09.404	It's a newspaper headline.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.09.404-00.34.13.779	Someone puts the new headline next to the old one.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.13.779-00.34.14.920	They look like a set.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.14.920-00.34.15.420	Even the font is similar.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.15.420-00.34.18.486	Someone stares at the old headline.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.18.486-00.34.28.000	Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.31.633-00.34.33.784	Someone gets startled.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.33.784-00.34.35.151	He puts back the clippings.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.35.151-00.34.36.566	Stuffing the new one inside with them.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.36.571-00.34.37.719	He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.38.344-00.34.41.067	He opens the door.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.41.067-00.34.43.486	Someone stands in the darkened hall.
2012_Unbreakable_00.34.45.454-00.34.47.668	Someone nods.
2012_Unbreakable_00.35.15.446-00.35.17.531	Someone stares at his wife.
2012_Unbreakable_00.35.22.309-00.35.30.136	She starts crying.
2012_Unbreakable_00.35.30.136-00.35.35.310	Tears roll over her very affected face.
2012_Unbreakable_00.35.35.310-00.35.42.385	She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.21.002-00.36.24.637	Someone nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.24.637-00.36.26.904	Someone watches her disappear into the shadows.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.29.762-00.36.31.869	The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.34.759-00.36.35.219	A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are ripping tickets.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.35.219-00.36.36.061	Someone stands to one side with two other security guards.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.36.061-00.36.36.875	The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles paraphernalia.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.36.875-00.36.40.219	A group of girls carries a homemade banner that Someone reads as he tilts his head sideways.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.45.261-00.36.46.108	Someone stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.46.108-00.36.46.841	The baby is wearing an eagles uniform.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.41.719-00.36.43.740	The WALKIE TALKIE on Someone's hip bursts to life.
2012_Unbreakable_00.36.43.740-00.36.45.200	He pulls it off his hip an listens.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.29.991-00.37.34.931	Someone bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.36.869-00.37.44.605	Someone looks backs at him and continues walking.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.46.880-00.37.54.563	Someone moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.54.563-00.37.55.570	Someone walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.55.570-00.37.57.082	Someone moves next to him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.37.58.254-00.38.02.913	Someone observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles.
2012_Unbreakable_00.38.04.150-00.38.08.025	The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line.
2012_Unbreakable_00.38.08.025-00.38.11.658	His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.38.20.221-00.38.25.314	He is twenty people from the turnstile.
2012_Unbreakable_00.38.25.627-00.38.30.507	Someone eyes him.
2012_Unbreakable_00.38.31.100-00.38.32.253	Fifteen people away.

2012_Unbreakable_01.18.17.021-01.18.24.962	One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling.
2012_Unbreakable_01.18.26.936-01.18.34.304	Someone stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains.

2012_Unbreakable_01.20.45.542-01.20.53.364	Then Someone steps back to look around.
2012_Unbreakable_01.20.53.364-01.20.55.769	HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing behind him.

2012_Unbreakable_01.21.39.956-01.21.43.075	He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

2012_Unbreakable_01.22.01.195-01.22.02.330	The huge man disappears with his bin inside.
2012_Unbreakable_01.22.02.330-01.22.03.607	Someone waits.

2012_Unbreakable_01.22.12.820-01.22.14.113	And then they open.

2012_Unbreakable_01.22.45.826-01.22.47.574	The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block.
2012_Unbreakable_01.22.47.574-01.22.49.589	Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he is passing are off at this late hour.
2012_Unbreakable_01.22.52.392-01.22.54.214	The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes.
2012_Unbreakable_01.22.54.214-01.22.54.714	The uniformed man walks slower in this block.
2012_Unbreakable_01.22.58.348-01.23.00.462	He looks around carefully as he moves.
2012_Unbreakable_01.23.00.462-01.23.02.493	He turns into a driveway of one of the homes.
2012_Unbreakable_01.23.02.493-01.23.05.070	He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox.

2012_Unbreakable_01.23.18.937-01.23.25.951	He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.
2012_Unbreakable_01.23.26.912-01.23.29.590	The side door opens with almost no sound.

2012_Unbreakable_01.24.00.110-01.24.03.772	It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another.
2012_Unbreakable_01.24.03.772-01.24.08.470	Someone moves slowly to a door in the kitchen.
2012_Unbreakable_01.24.08.889-01.24.10.391	It's slightly open.
2012_Unbreakable_01.24.10.391-01.24.12.016	As Someone gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell.
2012_Unbreakable_01.24.12.016-01.24.17.490	He pulls the door open quietly.
2012_Unbreakable_01.24.17.490-01.24.18.346	BASEMENT.

2012_Unbreakable_01.24.18.665-01.24.19.260	His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest.

2017_Bad_Santa_00.05.51.142-00.05.57.543	Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.03.380-00.06.04.072	The alarm continues to count down -- 15.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.05.59.398-00.06.03.380	The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.05.119-00.06.08.539	The Teddy bear scrambles for the door, crashing into everything in its path.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.09.615-00.06.14.313	Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.13.813-00.06.16.117	It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short to reach the controls.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.18.532-00.06.22.274	Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal his true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life known as Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.19.741-00.06.23.574	He is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.23.574-00.06.28.478	A hasp flips open and Someone swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.25.125-00.06.31.261	He finishes the beer, crushes the can and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.33.372-00.06.39.931	Someone sneers at him as he lumbers past.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.57.396-00.07.04.082	Someone reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular items.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.03.582-00.07.06.402	He drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed list before moving on.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.06.47.208-00.06.50.611	Someone pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to makeup.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.16.362-00.07.24.138	Someone arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Someone manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the store's vault.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.28.859-00.07.30.784	Someone moves closer as Someone pulls back the drill on the track.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.25.830-00.07.28.450	He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly and hits it with a sledgehammer.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.30.597-00.07.33.107	Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to the floor.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.33.107-00.07.35.703	Both men are impressed.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.37.281-00.07.44.266	Someone settles on the rear bench as Someone gets into the passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of several years, Someone, who is dressed in expensively ugly clothes, and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney distaste.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.07.45.383-00.07.52.556	The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.11.55.455-00.11.58.465	of An alarm clock ringing with a jolt.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.11.57.975-00.11.59.288	Someone, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.11.59.288-00.12.02.463	He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.02.463-00.12.07.857	In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.07.857-00.12.10.223	One final scream and it's out of his system.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.14.887-00.12.19.602	He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.19.602-00.12.24.406	He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.35.422-00.12.41.128	Someone's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.41.128-00.12.53.053	As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.53.053-00.12.57.198	As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.12.54.879-00.12.57.768	He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.13.34.954-00.13.41.568	Someone gets in and drives off.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.13.38.592-00.13.41.043	Someone drives.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.13.23.714-00.13.28.526	He reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.13.27.526-00.13.32.131	He focuses on the car owner's address.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.07.250-00.14.13.209	In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom, we see Someone sitting on the toilet, leafing through a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.07.250-00.14.11.773	Pants around his ankles.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.11.773-00.14.15.981	Someone, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.15.177-00.14.23.609	Someone, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.24.065-00.14.30.466	Sucking on his beer, Someone paces the periphery of the room, methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.32.840-00.14.44.756	Someone arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until, finally, he exposes a wall safe.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.14.53.643-00.14.59.050	A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.15.00.013-00.15.02.202	The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.15.02.202-00.15.06.920	Someone scratches a lottery ticket.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.15.19.547-00.15.21.009	He is now wearing a Rolex and some gaudy ring.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.15.45.573-00.15.57.355	As she exits, he activates the machine.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.15.57.555-00.16.00.234	Someone skips to the next message.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.16.35.726-00.16.45.519	Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement two mirage- like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square Mall parking lot -- people in Santa and Elf regalia, sweating and panting in the heat.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.16.53.424-00.17.04.486	Someone polishes off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash can.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.17.10.040-00.17.11.238	He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.17.47.532-00.17.52.294	Someone stomps away and right toward people as they enter the store.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.17.49.290-00.17.52.473	People stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.17.53.135-00.17.53.947	Someone watches with them.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.18.02.104-00.18.13.152	A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Someone's eye.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.18.04.089-00.18.10.855	He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.18.19.003-00.18.21.273	Someone's reaction worries Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.18.37.628-00.18.47.939	Someone pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.18.44.725-00.18.46.669	He is instantly composed.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.00.682-00.20.01.712	Someone the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.19.59.289-00.20.00.682	One in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.00.141-00.20.03.829	Again there is a line of waiting children.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.19.56.123-00.20.04.982	Someone makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.00.326-00.20.04.266	He plays to the crowd.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.38.572-00.20.41.747	He takes a bottle from the floor by his feet and swigs off it.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.26.607-00.20.28.150	Someone stares at him.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.20.35.703-00.20.38.572	He grabs the hat, slams it into Someone's chest and, as Someone rises, kicks him in the ass.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.21.53.320-00.21.56.650	On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot a city bus stops with a hiss.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.21.56.650-00.22.01.885	The doors swing open to reveal a pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD Someone, overweight, snot-nosed, badly dressed and probably smelling of pee.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.07.814-00.22.16.580	As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.00.541-00.22.03.629	They notice him.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.21.30.864-00.21.33.938	Someone puts another young boy on his lap.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.26.709-00.22.28.508	Someone walks over to the rope.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.30.695-00.22.34.416	The snot-nosed Someone is next in line, frozen by fear.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.43.984-00.22.45.563	This penetrates Someone's fear.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.50.213-00.22.53.001	He moves.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.22.53.001-00.22.58.867	Someone leads Someone up to the throne and places him on Someone's lap.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.00.400-00.23.02.801	Someone just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.05.772-00.23.09.208	Someone can't help but stare at it.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.11.960-00.23.14.849	Suddenly Someone is moved to yank Someone's beard.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.32.912-00.23.40.411	He holds it stretched below Someone's chin.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.39.411-00.23.43.201	Someone shoves Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.41.658-00.23.46.988	Someone backs away, looking at him.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.41.658-00.23.45.828	Someone backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.23.55.384-00.23.57.845	Someone sits on a bench watching the entrance to Someone's.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.00.592-00.24.11.508	After a beat people walk out in costume and cross toward the parking lot.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.21.925-00.24.26.940	Someone follows from a safe distance.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.02.140-00.24.08.053	People walk across the huge empty parking lot, followed at a great distance by Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.21.925-00.24.26.814	As Someone creeps closer, he is able to hear their conversation.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.38.337-00.24.43.548	A large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie middle-management.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.24.42.259-00.24.55.047	We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a HINDUSTANI TROUBLEMAKER, sitting right across from him, startling Someone for a moment.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.25.39.904-00.25.45.703	She pours two.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.25.45.703-00.25.49.179	They both pound them back.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.25.59.375-00.26.04.296	As she pours.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.26.24.194-00.26.27.400	Someone stares at her.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.27.35.728-00.27.44.766	The man stares at him for a beat.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.28.04.039-00.28.06.946	The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find Someone beating on his legs.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.28.06.946-00.28.10.110	Someone gets a chance to regain composure.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.28.33.886-00.28.39.791	Someone sits in the front seat next to Someone who drives, stewing.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.28.39.791-00.28.45.705	Someone answers absently, his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.30.12.677-00.30.28.681	Someone escorts Someone along a long walkway that leads to the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern home.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.30.24.094-00.30.28.681	Someone admires the surroundings.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.30.57.484-00.31.06.623	Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker and begins to move toward Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.06.623-00.31.09.304	She wears a bathrobe and thick glasses and has another pair of glasses on a chain around her neck.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.09.304-00.31.11.884	He watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.28.962-00.31.32.198	He yanks off his mask and turns to Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.16.137-00.31.18.026	Someone shakes his head.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.18.026-00.31.20.079	Someone shakes his head.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.32.695-00.31.38.982	The sound of a tumbler tripping and, suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Someone with his stethoscope in his ears.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.33.629-00.31.37.214	In the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.33.629-00.31.35.290	Someone reaches in.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.35.290-00.31.54.668	Someone grabs the folio and flips through it.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.31.55.303-00.32.02.513	At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.35.16.301-00.35.24.112	People walk to their cars.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.37.27.373-00.37.31.787	Someone looks at him with disdain.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.38.02.832-00.38.07.852	Reluctantly, she sidles over.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.38.18.431-00.38.25.501	Someone is at a pay phone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.38.36.061-00.38.39.548	Someone swings the door open to Someone, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.38.43.419-00.39.04.437	Someone follows Someone like a puppy dog as Someone checks out the house, bumping open doors, looking around.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.39.04.437-00.39.13.335	Someone has discovered the master bedroom, by appearances long unused.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.39.13.335-00.39.16.402	He tosses his grip onto the double bed.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.39.47.928-00.39.57.047	Someone lies in the tub, also motionless, a wet washcloth over his face, fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.39.59.168-00.40.02.631	From under his washcloth.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.40.09.648-00.40.12.972	He drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the kid.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.40.18.189-00.40.21.861	Someone looks at him, unperturbed.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.43.22.812-00.43.32.543	She glances in as the person passes and, still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something down.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.47.12.897-00.47.15.581	Someone stares at the board for a long beat.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.47.34.568-00.47.38.850	He leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.47.54.887-00.47.59.091	ANGLE ON Someone's face, unfazed, still smiling.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.49.04.233-00.49.04.342	Someone lies in bed, sleeping peacefully.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.49.21.457-00.49.29.405	Someone bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.49.21.457-00.49.26.756	He is wearing his Santa hat.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.51.12.720-00.51.15.326	Blearily she gazes back.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.51.31.146-00.51.34.346	He closes the door.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.15.596-00.52.22.674	He then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.22.674-00.52.25.372	Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.25.372-00.52.31.666	A beat later -- WHAM! He faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.35.569-00.52.37.959	Someone wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.37.097-00.52.38.944	A bedroom door crashes open and Someone emerges screaming and runs right into Someone.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.41.994-00.52.46.427	He immediately caroms off and goes screaming down the hall.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.45.780-00.52.46.547	He turns the corner to the hall, There is a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.07.223-00.53.09.948	Someone, screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.48.824-00.52.50.596	Someone follows.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.50.596-00.52.52.210	Someone enters.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.44.159-00.52.49.167	He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Someone yanks away.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.52.52.677-00.52.57.755	As Someone drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, Someone takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.01.775-00.53.06.952	Someone grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.04.892-00.53.08.270	Someone shrieks.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.43.631-00.53.46.544	It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Someone' van.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.46.544-00.53.51.115	The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.52.161-00.53.55.917	Someone throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.59.219-00.54.01.330	Someone wears a forbearing smile.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.53.58.672-00.54.01.737	He shakes his head and chuckles as Someone tosses him an empty red Santa sack.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.01.737-00.54.04.505	Someone stares.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.32.418-00.54.37.048	Someone, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for people.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.34.874-00.54.39.116	They enter in costume.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.41.000-00.54.43.421	Someone lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.35.104-00.54.40.805	As people enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.40.921-00.54.44.079	Someone drops the bag with a loud thud.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.39.651-00.54.42.630	Someone follows Someone behind the Wonderland backdrop.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.54.46.875-00.54.49.179	Someone points to an air duct in the ceiling.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.56.31.062-00.56.35.270	He gets up and walks away.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.58.09.116-00.58.14.522	Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.58.16.025-00.58.17.850	Someone sits opposite.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.59.07.614-00.59.12.817	A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.59.26.126-00.59.30.823	Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.59.30.823-00.59.36.737	People go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team.
2017_Bad_Santa_00.59.34.164-00.59.37.319	Someone sees off another child.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.00.16.690-01.00.18.340	Someone stares at him.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.01.27.571-01.01.32.597	Someone returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.03.21.642-01.03.24.521	Someone sighs.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.03.39.748-01.03.42.943	Gin leaves.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.07.23.632-01.07.26.437	Someone's eyes do not leave the spot in space.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.07.49.010-01.07.52.947	Someone turns to go.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.07.55.093-01.07.58.235	Someone beckons him.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.07.58.235-01.07.59.916	He displays an envelope.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.08.17.995-01.08.19.112	Someone's eye is indeed black and blue.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.08.33.893-01.08.34.141	He reaches self- consciously up to it.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.09.02.220-01.09.05.223	Someone, dreamy, refuses to take the bait.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.09.26.912-01.09.32.709	Someone stares at him.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.16.32.912-01.16.38.168	Someone, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.09.39.097-01.09.39.425	She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.16.46.305-01.16.49.177	Someone is in the driver's seat.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.16.51.985-01.17.01.460	Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Someone flags him down.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.01.460-01.17.12.369	SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.12.369-01.17.20.811	He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.15.380-01.17.20.555	He shakes his head in disgust.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.33.404-01.17.37.572	Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.33.139-01.17.40.183	He gets out and raises the hood.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.42.155-01.17.44.721	The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.44.721-01.17.50.360	Someone seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.17.53.792-01.17.57.097	Gin attaches the cables.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.18.35.877-01.18.39.235	Then, leaning down to Gin.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.22.23.808-01.22.28.430	Behind Someone, in Men's Wear, is Someone, wearing a frown of pruney disapproval.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.22.33.868-01.22.44.550	Seeing that he is not looking, she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.22.44.730-01.22.47.468	SQUEEEEEEEAK! The table makes a loud noise, but it's too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.22.46.468-01.22.49.003	Satisfied with her placement of the table, Someone heads out the door.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.22.54.521-01.22.59.256	Someone cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.01.569-01.23.03.812	Someone grimaces.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.23.786-01.23.28.307	Someone heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled ARM.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.28.307-01.23.32.497	An LED readout labeled ARMING counts down from 30 seconds.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.32.202-01.23.35.087	Someone arrives at the vent above the surveillance room.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.35.087-01.23.38.224	He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Someone bought, and aims it down into the room.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.37.243-01.23.38.784	The huge bank of VCRs powers down.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.23.42.471-01.23.48.956	Someone arrives at the precipice of a descending duct.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.24.13.184-01.24.18.981	Someone stares at the safe.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.02.542-01.25.05.536	Someone continues to stare at the safe.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.14.787-01.25.16.152	He licks his lips.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.19.184-01.25.21.923	Meanwhile, Someone emerges from a stockroom with a cart to begin his shopping spree.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.22.992-01.25.26.659	Someone applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one hand and listening intently.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.26.309-01.25.28.958	Someone starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.31.901-01.25.34.944	Someone applies the drill to the safe.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.38.147-01.25.41.332	Someone pulls back the drill.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.02.605-01.26.08.206	Someone is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.42.412-01.25.46.975	Someone batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.03.158-01.26.06.013	Someone continues to leap at the mannequin.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.26.309-01.26.27.739	Someone is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.22.053-01.26.27.309	Someone swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.25.41.252-01.25.46.842	Someone uses a plasma welder on the safe.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.40.102-01.26.49.629	Someone, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its stole.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.35.670-01.26.38.024	Someone is back over the safe, battering it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.48.410-01.26.54.033	Someone is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.54.033-01.26.58.505	Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.50.005-01.26.54.007	Someone reacts quizzically.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.54.007-01.26.58.116	After a considering moment he rises.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.26.58.116-01.27.04.638	we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as it finishes creaking open.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.04.638-01.27.08.423	Someone enters the room.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.07.612-01.27.10.036	Someone looks at him.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.21.771-01.27.29.134	Someone starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.29.134-01.27.33.155	We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.33.988-01.27.46.859	Someone's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.42.621-01.27.45.286	The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.45.286-01.27.50.664	The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.27.53.611-01.27.56.414	Someone turns around holding the stuffed elephant.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.06.464-01.28.10.236	People are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: Someone has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.06.464-01.28.07.433	She wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.07.456-01.28.08.955	Next to her Someone holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, sprouting -- cash.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.10.103-01.28.12.484	Something in this picture makes Someone uneasy.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.35.510-01.28.38.379	He primes the gun.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.28.44.982-01.28.46.978	Someone murmurs, more in sadness than in fear.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.29.40.189-01.29.43.858	Someone points the gun.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.29.34.225-01.29.36.745	A silence.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.29.38.683-01.29.41.182	Someone sighs.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.29.13.788-01.29.17.521	Someone stares.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.29.46.651-01.29.48.718	Someone looks wildly around.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.04.052-01.30.06.097	He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.17.804-01.30.21.702	Someone reaches the end of the counter.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.38.902-01.30.42.736	A brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.44.123-01.30.46.335	Someone bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.47.461-01.30.55.061	He dives into his Mercedes and peels out.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.54.636-01.30.58.016	Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Someone comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.30.58.016-01.31.00.059	Cops yell, draw their guns and fire as Someone clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.00.059-01.31.02.651	He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.02.073-01.31.03.863	Someone drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.18.416-01.31.20.607	He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.26.194-01.31.32.710	Someone's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.32.710-01.31.40.398	The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.43.926-01.31.49.279	Cops leap out of their cars just as Someone jumps from his.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.50.863-01.31.52.591	Someone is sprinting up the walk toward the front door.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.31.53.595-01.31.55.372	He bounds up the stoop.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.32.43.054-01.32.57.844	We are FADING IN on a shelf in Someone's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.33.04.019-01.33.05.496	We PAN OFF of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.32.57.844-01.33.03.041	Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.33.03.041-01.33.06.258	We TRACK toward it.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.33.33.644-01.33.39.514	Grandma is in the living room watching TV.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.33.39.514-01.33.43.666	We TRACK past her towards the Jacuzzi area.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.33.36.255-01.33.41.320	Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the Jacuzzi.
2017_Bad_Santa_01.34.00.819-01.34.07.379	Someone walks by her carrying a bucket.
2034_Super_8_00.02.12.553-00.02.16.719	We now see Someone, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and Someone, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet.
2034_Super_8_00.01.27.635-00.01.29.096	CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979.
2034_Super_8_00.01.41.992-00.01.44.912	Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed.
2034_Super_8_00.01.44.912-00.01.47.135	Quiet discussions.
2034_Super_8_00.01.47.135-00.01.50.337	Some crying.
2034_Super_8_00.01.29.862-00.01.30.456	A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO.
2034_Super_8_00.01.30.456-00.01.31.276	Many cars are parked outside the house, notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
2034_Super_8_00.01.31.276-00.01.31.835	Someone, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
2034_Super_8_00.01.31.835-00.01.34.370	He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds.
2034_Super_8_00.02.42.653-00.02.43.912	Then a SOUND.
2034_Super_8_00.02.43.912-00.02.44.669	Someone looks up.
2034_Super_8_00.02.44.680-00.02.46.501	A CAR has arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center.
2034_Super_8_00.02.46.501-00.02.49.315	Someone watches as the car sits there for a moment.
2034_Super_8_00.02.49.389-00.02.51.639	Then a MAN gets out.
2034_Super_8_00.02.54.202-00.02.55.669	A man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt.
2034_Super_8_00.02.57.229-00.03.08.405	Someone watches Someone carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house.
2034_Super_8_00.03.08.405-00.03.11.410	Someone's eyes glued on the house for a while.
2034_Super_8_00.03.11.410-00.03.13.085	Then he looks back to the locket.
2034_Super_8_00.03.14.800-00.03.16.238	And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
2034_Super_8_00.03.16.238-00.03.18.759	A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Someone turns toward the house.
2034_Super_8_00.03.18.759-00.03.21.107	After a beat, the SOUND of something BREAKING -- something glass.
2034_Super_8_00.03.21.107-00.03.39.243	Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Someone cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Someone, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Someone from the house and into the rear of the squad car.
2034_Super_8_00.03.39.285-00.03.41.826	When he slams the back door, he sees Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.03.41.826-00.03.44.032	Sort of freezes as their eyes lock.
2034_Super_8_00.03.45.160-00.03.46.412	But Someone's more uncomfortable.
2034_Super_8_00.03.46.412-00.03.52.487	And Someone gets into the car and drives away.
2034_Super_8_00.03.52.487-00.03.59.639	Someone watches them drive off.
2034_Super_8_00.03.59.639-00.04.02.617	And after a beat, he looks down at the locket again.
2034_Super_8_00.04.02.617-00.04.03.771	Finally he CLOSES IT
2034_Super_8_00.04.14.323-00.04.17.935	Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory.
2034_Super_8_00.04.17.935-00.04.19.535	GIRLS emphatically embrace each other good-bye.
2034_Super_8_00.04.19.535-00.04.22.399	BOYS run off, just happy to be out.
2034_Super_8_00.04.26.457-00.04.30.577	Suddenly Someone is there, red-faced -- he hands Someone PAGES.
2034_Super_8_00.04.30.577-00.04.35.814	They head across the street to the 7-Eleven.
2034_Super_8_00.04.36.681-00.04.39.736	Suddenly Someone is there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now.
2034_Super_8_00.04.47.774-00.04.49.451	Someone stops.
2034_Super_8_00.04.49.451-00.04.50.820	His friends don't.
2034_Super_8_00.04.51.669-00.04.55.799	People scan the candy aisle.
2034_Super_8_00.06.23.255-00.06.25.428	Someone just nods and looks at the magazine.
2034_Super_8_00.06.27.797-00.06.28.884	A hectic FAMILY: Someone' mother cooks.
2034_Super_8_00.06.28.884-00.06.30.415	Someone, his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father pays bills.
2034_Super_8_00.06.30.415-00.06.31.908	Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE.
2034_Super_8_00.06.31.908-00.06.32.723	Twin 9- YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure.
2034_Super_8_00.06.32.723-00.06.35.785	TV in the living room plays a MATCH GAME.
2034_Super_8_00.06.35.785-00.06.37.627	Someone enter.
2034_Super_8_00.06.38.560-00.06.40.828	Someone grabs a roll.
2034_Super_8_00.07.40.856-00.07.43.366	Someone nods as Someone forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
2034_Super_8_00.07.43.627-00.07.44.920	HOLD ON Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.07.44.920-00.07.46.138	Stunned and heartsick.
2034_Super_8_00.07.55.064-00.07.55.948	Someone and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter.
2034_Super_8_00.07.55.948-00.07.58.587	Someone pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table.
2034_Super_8_00.08.28.766-00.08.34.758	Someone looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP.
2034_Super_8_00.08.56.066-00.08.58.280	Images of happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS.
2034_Super_8_00.08.58.280-00.09.02.317	Someone looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and Someone sees that Someone is HOLDING HIS MOTHER'S LOCKET.
2034_Super_8_00.09.02.716-00.09.03.680	Someone wants to cry again.
2034_Super_8_00.09.03.680-00.09.04.565	He wants to throw that locket away, out of sight.
2034_Super_8_00.09.04.565-00.09.07.924	But he just turns away.
2034_Super_8_00.09.07.924-00.09.12.183	Someone stares at the pamphlet.
2034_Super_8_00.09.16.299-00.09.18.398	TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model.
2034_Super_8_00.09.18.398-00.09.25.632	RACK FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO Someone, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model.
2034_Super_8_00.09.25.632-00.09.26.675	A boy's room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess.
2034_Super_8_00.09.26.675-00.09.27.875	COMIC BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.09.27.875-00.09.29.091	CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN.
2034_Super_8_00.10.08.931-00.10.11.319	All the boys look.
2034_Super_8_00.10.11.319-00.10.14.309	Their faces BRIGHTEN.
2034_Super_8_00.10.14.309-00.10.15.523	Headlights.
2034_Super_8_00.10.15.523-00.10.18.985	The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK.
2034_Super_8_00.10.18.985-00.10.22.639	But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14- year-old Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.10.22.639-00.10.26.458	She sees Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.10.54.016-00.10.54.864	Looking away, she is pissed.
2034_Super_8_00.10.54.864-00.10.57.808	All the boys in silent wait.
2034_Super_8_00.10.57.808-00.10.59.280	She considers, annoyed.
2034_Super_8_00.10.59.280-00.11.01.494	Shakes her head.
2034_Super_8_00.11.01.494-00.11.03.678	The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
2034_Super_8_00.11.04.307-00.11.06.379	The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape.
2034_Super_8_00.11.06.379-00.11.08.120	Someone messes with the radio.
2034_Super_8_00.11.17.861-00.11.19.538	Someone looks at him in the rear view.
2034_Super_8_00.11.19.538-00.11.20.720	Their eyes hold a beat.
2034_Super_8_00.11.20.720-00.11.22.708	She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.
2034_Super_8_00.11.57.051-00.12.01.765	Someone walks past Someone, who watches him.
2034_Super_8_00.12.12.852-00.12.17.134	Someone sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines.
2034_Super_8_00.12.23.603-00.12.24.863	And she looks at him.
2034_Super_8_00.12.24.863-00.12.25.794	Almost as if she were looking for something.
2034_Super_8_00.12.25.794-00.12.27.093	Someone stops stippling.
2034_Super_8_00.12.27.093-00.12.27.730	The tension is almost too much for him to bear.
2034_Super_8_00.12.27.730-00.12.30.380	He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up.
2034_Super_8_00.13.15.623-00.13.17.191	She does.
2034_Super_8_00.13.17.191-00.13.18.549	Someone starts applying the make-up to her eyelids.
2034_Super_8_00.13.18.549-00.13.22.696	There's something provocative for Someone, being so close to Someone, with her eyes closed.
2034_Super_8_00.13.26.613-00.13.28.166	Someone has been made up, wears a coat with purse.
2034_Super_8_00.13.28.166-00.13.30.081	Someone, in his tie, faces her.
2034_Super_8_00.13.22.558-00.13.26.613	They both look over their script pages as Someone adjusts the camera.
2034_Super_8_00.13.47.503-00.13.49.887	Someone, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Someone wears an overcoat.
2034_Super_8_00.13.51.790-00.13.54.686	POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Someone turns -- Someone, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker.
2034_Super_8_00.14.09.487-00.14.16.364	People now perform as their characters, people.
2034_Super_8_00.14.16.364-00.14.23.029	Someone walks past them, acting in the background.
2034_Super_8_00.14.25.421-00.14.28.027	We are TIGHT ON Someone, watching Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.14.31.764-00.14.33.158	Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role.
2034_Super_8_00.14.36.261-00.14.43.767	And holy shit, Someone actually starts to cry as she performs her lines.
2034_Super_8_00.14.44.286-00.14.46.316	Someone watches -- in awe -- he is suddenly, giddily transported.
2034_Super_8_00.14.46.316-00.14.50.314	But it's Someone who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Someone has just set.
2034_Super_8_00.15.16.683-00.15.22.252	Someone is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
2034_Super_8_00.15.24.553-00.15.27.524	And in the heat of it, Someone looks at Someone, unsure.
2034_Super_8_00.15.53.434-00.15.54.751	As Someone runs to Someone, takes her script pages.
2034_Super_8_00.16.16.856-00.16.19.282	They are set to film toward Someone, the approaching train in her background -- Someone puts on the headphones.
2034_Super_8_00.16.19.282-00.16.25.367	And they are shooting.
2034_Super_8_00.16.52.103-00.16.59.998	Someone looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS.
2034_Super_8_00.17.00.520-00.17.06.247	PUSH IN ON Someone, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Someone looks back toward Someone -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD.
2034_Super_8_00.17.06.247-00.17.16.663	People continue to yell their lines -- Someone is almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Someone LOOKS DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING.
2034_Super_8_00.17.16.663-00.17.17.765	And Someone finally swings the mike down and YELLS.
2034_Super_8_00.17.22.946-00.17.28.851	They run off.
2034_Super_8_00.17.28.851-00.17.38.524	Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH- SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
2034_Super_8_00.18.34.033-00.18.44.246	In the DUST, Someone lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut.
2034_Super_8_00.18.44.246-00.18.51.161	His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD METAL BANG! Someone stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around him.
2034_Super_8_00.18.51.161-00.18.52.299	Just another few feet and he would've been crushed.
2034_Super_8_00.18.52.299-00.19.03.335	But what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Someone BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN -- MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then AGAIN and AGAIN!!! We see Someone TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND -- THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE.
2034_Super_8_00.19.03.335-00.19.04.330	-- Someone covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR.
2034_Super_8_00.19.04.330-00.19.07.711	Someone turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it is GONE.
2034_Super_8_00.19.19.917-00.19.24.580	TIGHT ON Someone' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A.
2034_Super_8_00.20.02.090-00.20.04.653	Someone MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Someone appears, smiling.
2034_Super_8_00.20.04.653-00.20.07.122	This kid enjoyed the crash.
2034_Super_8_00.20.28.122-00.20.33.013	Someone WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is Someone -- shaken, but absolutely alive.
2034_Super_8_00.20.33.013-00.20.34.686	Someone just BEAMS.
2034_Super_8_00.20.40.219-00.20.42.996	But Someone SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out.
2034_Super_8_00.20.42.996-00.20.48.007	Someone pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT.
2034_Super_8_00.20.48.093-00.20.49.671	He brightens.
2034_Super_8_00.20.55.980-00.21.08.414	Someone looks -- they all move to Someone (except Someone, who heads off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground.
2034_Super_8_00.21.08.414-00.21.13.508	Someone kneels, picks one up.
2034_Super_8_00.21.13.508-00.21.22.424	Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Someone calls out.
2034_Super_8_00.21.22.424-00.21.26.795	They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK.
2034_Super_8_00.21.26.795-00.21.32.491	It seems to stretch on forever.
2034_Super_8_00.21.43.008-00.21.47.860	He points.
2034_Super_8_00.21.47.860-00.21.50.738	Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK.
2034_Super_8_00.21.50.738-00.21.51.722	SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown grass.
2034_Super_8_00.21.55.216-00.21.56.710	BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids approach from the wreckage.
2034_Super_8_00.21.56.710-00.21.59.673	PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at the truck and STOP; what they see makes Someone's heart pound -- they are stunned -- all of them.
2034_Super_8_00.21.59.673-00.22.02.973	They just stop.
2034_Super_8_00.22.02.973-00.22.08.430	WE SEE NOW: it's Someone -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage.
2034_Super_8_00.22.11.325-00.22.34.110	Someone moves closer,scared and sad for him.
2034_Super_8_00.22.45.851-00.22.51.231	But he is apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground.
2034_Super_8_00.22.55.167-00.22.56.569	Someone picks it up.
2034_Super_8_00.22.56.569-00.23.04.203	UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
2034_Super_8_00.23.04.203-00.23.05.365	They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.23.05.365-00.23.06.541	We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.
2034_Super_8_00.23.11.100-00.23.15.849	But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD Someone IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE.
2034_Super_8_00.23.17.414-00.23.20.103	They are all speechless for a moment.
2034_Super_8_00.23.28.364-00.23.39.834	Finally, too loudly.
2034_Super_8_00.24.00.479-00.24.04.477	We are on Someone's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck.
2034_Super_8_00.24.04.477-00.24.07.904	The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them.
2034_Super_8_00.24.07.904-00.24.12.556	The kids start moving away.
2034_Super_8_00.24.18.883-00.24.22.453	Someone arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
2034_Super_8_00.24.25.798-00.24.27.108	Someone hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
2034_Super_8_00.24.22.802-00.24.25.798	Someone grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.24.27.906-00.24.44.056	As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Someone runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Someone SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their adrenaline pumping.
2034_Super_8_00.24.44.056-00.24.50.012	One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.24.50.012-00.24.51.501	He then looks to the ground in front of him.
2034_Super_8_00.24.51.501-00.24.52.547	CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX.
2034_Super_8_00.24.52.547-00.24.54.078	Someone steps to it, picks it up.
2034_Super_8_00.24.54.078-00.24.56.195	Looks at it.
2034_Super_8_00.24.56.195-00.25.00.098	Then back up at the disappearing car.
2034_Super_8_00.25.00.098-00.25.01.159	We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND.
2034_Super_8_00.25.01.259-00.25.03.107	RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past.
2034_Super_8_00.25.03.107-00.25.06.181	Overlapping mayhem, but Someone obsesses over his camera.
2034_Super_8_00.25.09.164-00.25.11.175	As Someone nervously drives, she shakes her head: no.
2034_Super_8_00.25.44.724-00.25.49.285	Someone nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.25.49.285-00.25.50.337	But they all stare off for a long beat.
2034_Super_8_00.25.50.404-00.25.52.302	CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up.
2034_Super_8_00.25.52.302-00.25.54.183	The dusty boys pile out.
2034_Super_8_00.25.54.183-00.25.55.230	They all kind of look at each other.
2034_Super_8_00.25.55.230-00.25.56.218	Someone, who looks at Someone for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod.
2034_Super_8_00.25.56.218-00.25.56.814	Someone nods.
2034_Super_8_00.25.56.814-00.25.58.619	Someone finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.
2034_Super_8_00.25.58.619-00.25.59.608	Someone goes to the window.
2034_Super_8_00.25.59.608-00.25.59.919	Someone holds it out: THE CUBE.
2034_Super_8_00.25.59.919-00.26.01.022	He takes it with.
2034_Super_8_00.27.28.251-00.27.29.921	It all continues as Someone has entered from the front door.
2034_Super_8_00.27.35.390-00.27.39.985	Someone is moving toward the living room, where Someone sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck.
2034_Super_8_00.28.17.792-00.28.18.993	Both stare at the train crash, stunned.
2034_Super_8_00.28.18.993-00.28.23.669	And we PUSH IN ON Someone, going from depressed and lost to.
2034_Super_8_00.28.42.264-00.28.45.205	Someone ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE, the massive STEEL MILL in the background.
2034_Super_8_00.28.45.205-00.28.47.633	TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Someone ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device.
2034_Super_8_00.29.26.189-00.29.28.467	As Someone opens the camera, pulls out the film.
2034_Super_8_00.29.34.689-00.29.38.025	Someone reacts; he is never smoked anything.
2034_Super_8_00.30.01.423-00.30.03.485	Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods.
2034_Super_8_00.30.03.485-00.30.05.843	Someone with Someone at her front door.
2034_Super_8_00.30.05.843-00.30.07.700	She seems unnerved.
2034_Super_8_00.30.15.621-00.30.22.988	Someone watches Someone get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery bag.
2034_Super_8_00.30.22.988-00.30.27.742	He sees Someone and darkens as he approaches.
2034_Super_8_00.30.32.684-00.30.39.438	Someone steps back as Someone arrives; Someone seems to hate Someone, but at the same time, can barely look at him.
2034_Super_8_00.30.56.909-00.31.00.326	Someone goes back inside.
2034_Super_8_00.31.01.199-00.31.04.275	Someone follows, turns to Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.31.05.089-00.31.05.702	Then, quietly, conflicted.
2034_Super_8_00.31.05.702-00.31.07.576	She closes the door.
2034_Super_8_00.31.07.576-00.31.18.183	Alone, despite it all, Someone is happy.
2034_Super_8_00.31.18.631-00.31.20.777	Off his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM.
2034_Super_8_00.31.20.777-00.31.25.163	Someone -- as Someone -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting Someone, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE -- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND.
2034_Super_8_00.31.25.163-00.31.27.472	We then find Someone, behind his camera, yelling out.
2034_Super_8_00.31.27.472-00.31.33.020	WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble.
2034_Super_8_00.31.33.020-00.31.33.545	People, with Someone's dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered.
2034_Super_8_00.31.33.545-00.31.33.916	KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to people, who were on camera.
2034_Super_8_00.31.33.916-00.31.34.286	Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever.

2034_Super_8_00.31.34.441-00.31.34.626	HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky.
2034_Super_8_00.31.44.008-00.31.46.487	Someone moves over to Someone, who looks out at the crash.
2034_Super_8_00.31.46.487-00.31.48.196	CLOSE ON Someone as he arrives beside Someone, who looks out at the train, haunted.

2034_Super_8_00.31.58.231-00.32.11.076	Someone moves the camera back to Someone -- he looks through the lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE Someone's POV -- the CRASH, ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
2034_Super_8_00.32.11.162-00.32.17.003	Someone watches Someone, who peers into the camera for a long beat, finally standing up, looking out at the crash.
2034_Super_8_00.32.18.127-00.32.22.072	The kids sit at a table at the window.
2034_Super_8_00.32.22.072-00.32.22.892	The CAR LOT is across the street.
2034_Super_8_00.32.22.892-00.32.24.390	They are talking excitedly but quietly.
2034_Super_8_00.32.24.390-00.32.26.694	A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD.
2034_Super_8_00.32.27.602-00.32.28.770	Someone smiles at Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.33.35.649-00.33.37.874	This lands for Someone -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO.

2034_Super_8_00.34.27.740-00.34.30.580	Someone looks at Someone -- not quite believing him.
2034_Super_8_00.34.44.331-00.34.47.247	Someone is with Someone, who stands, distracted, picking up reports from his desk, on his way out.
2034_Super_8_00.35.23.162-00.35.24.921	Someone walks off.
2034_Super_8_00.35.24.921-00.35.26.390	Someone, unsettled, watches him go.
2034_Super_8_00.35.34.017-00.35.34.826	FINGERS TAPPING -- they are fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN sitting beside them.
2034_Super_8_00.35.34.826-00.35.35.249	BOOM UP to 23-year-old Someone, who digs the BLONDIE he is listening to.

2034_Super_8_00.36.03.660-00.36.04.783	He exits the store.
2034_Super_8_00.38.51.407-00.38.53.507	Someone is suddenly there, with Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.39.02.791-00.39.03.847	Gnarly! people head off, planning the explosions.
2034_Super_8_00.39.03.847-00.39.07.668	Someone looks at him knowingly.
2034_Super_8_00.39.46.578-00.39.54.461	Someone considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her best zombie.
2034_Super_8_00.39.59.430-00.40.02.751	Someone smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
2034_Super_8_00.40.02.751-00.40.17.014	And Someone slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance? Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Someone go still -- a shiver down his spine -- he is never felt anything like this in his life.
2034_Super_8_00.40.17.014-00.40.18.284	And when she pulls back, her performance over, she is smiling.
2034_Super_8_00.40.30.595-00.40.34.494	We are NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Someone, EDIE and Someone come out here.

2034_Super_8_00.41.48.387-00.42.05.856	He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area.
2034_Super_8_00.41.52.468-00.41.53.892	Someone is disturbed by this.
2034_Super_8_00.42.06.337-00.42.08.450	Someone rides along a hillside.

2034_Super_8_00.42.43.195-00.42.49.933	Someone moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene.
2034_Super_8_00.43.02.279-00.43.08.216	Someone has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all turn, silent.
2034_Super_8_00.43.08.216-00.43.09.181	Someone, on the spot.
2034_Super_8_00.43.35.518-00.43.39.181	Someone paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching In Search Of and talking to Someone on his walkie talkie.

2034_Super_8_00.46.01.607-00.46.10.607	Currently, Someone, 52, speaks into the microphone on the floor.
2034_Super_8_00.46.10.607-00.46.13.455	The town ROARS its approval -- Someone, impotent, tries.

2034_Super_8_00.47.32.096-00.47.36.956	Someone heads out -- HOLD ON Someone AS he turns, ENTERS HIS OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO.
2034_Super_8_00.47.37.402-00.47.38.779	The door opens of his messy, motherless room.
2034_Super_8_00.47.38.779-00.47.39.957	People enter.
2034_Super_8_00.47.39.957-00.47.42.237	He could not be more self-conscious.
2034_Super_8_00.47.42.237-00.47.45.864	He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks.
2034_Super_8_00.47.45.864-00.47.47.384	He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair.
2034_Super_8_00.47.47.384-00.47.50.769	She looks around sa she enters.

2034_Super_8_00.48.12.777-00.48.15.231	She really looks at it.
2034_Super_8_00.49.03.148-00.49.09.662	Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.49.21.806-00.49.25.963	Someone with Someone (24).
2034_Super_8_00.49.31.274-00.49.34.380	Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.
2034_Super_8_00.49.34.380-00.49.39.018	Someone is stunned.
2034_Super_8_00.49.39.018-00.49.42.107	Someone at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK.
2034_Super_8_00.49.42.107-00.49.46.398	He takes notes.
2034_Super_8_00.50.13.301-00.50.17.776	Someone behind the camera, Someone beside him.
2034_Super_8_00.50.28.584-00.50.33.292	As it continues, we see Someone behind the camera, watching Someone, smiling.
2034_Super_8_00.50.36.653-00.50.41.369	But then she sees something that disturbs her: Someone's CRUISER pulls up.
2034_Super_8_00.50.41.369-00.50.43.690	Someone enters, crosses to Someone, who reviews a folder.
2034_Super_8_00.50.49.117-00.50.52.949	But Someone has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
2034_Super_8_00.50.59.373-00.51.12.100	Someone spins around as Someone arrives, grabs his camera from Someone and saying firmly, to Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.51.12.100-00.51.16.346	Someone is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Someone -- he is taken back to the squad car.
2034_Super_8_00.51.16.346-00.51.22.865	Someone OPENS the car's back door -- Someone gets in -- Someone SLAMS it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Someone in the back.
2034_Super_8_00.51.28.887-00.51.29.705	Someone heads outside -- Someone moves to him.
2034_Super_8_00.51.29.705-00.51.32.103	This lands on Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.51.41.719-00.51.44.863	Someone heads off.
2034_Super_8_00.51.44.863-00.51.46.550	Someone stops, turns to uncomfortable Someone.
2034_Super_8_00.51.20.423-00.51.23.119	Someone, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Someone, close again.
2034_Super_8_00.51.24.469-00.51.24.855	Someone watches him sympathetically.
2034_Super_8_00.51.57.033-00.51.58.293	Door opens.
2034_Super_8_00.51.58.293-00.51.59.792	Someone enters, then lets Someone pass him.
2034_Super_8_00.51.59.792-00.52.01.672	Someone closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained.
2034_Super_8_00.52.39.724-00.52.43.993	Someone turns to leave -- but Someone, enraged, says.
2034_Super_8_00.52.43.993-00.52.47.327	Someone stops -- stunned -- Someone's heart pounds.
2034_Super_8_00.53.00.088-00.53.01.789	Someone moves CLOSE to Someone -- intimidating -- Someone steps back -- Someone is fucking intense.
2034_Super_8_00.53.02.395-00.53.06.282	Someone suddenly stops himself, realizing what he is saying.
2034_Super_8_00.53.06.282-00.53.10.280	And to whom he is saying it.
2034_Super_8_00.53.13.755-00.53.18.152	But somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer.
2034_Super_8_00.53.25.029-00.53.33.086	More upset at himself than Someone, he heads out.
2034_Super_8_00.53.40.844-00.53.47.294	Someone rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.
2034_Super_8_00.54.00.534-00.54.09.219	Someone sits, his back against his mother's grave.
2034_Super_8_00.54.09.219-00.54.17.165	Holds her OPEN LOCKET, staring at it.
2034_Super_8_00.54.17.165-00.54.20.617	But then -- a SOUND -- and Someone turns.
2034_Super_8_00.54.20.617-00.54.22.056	Deep and low, in the distance.
2034_Super_8_00.54.22.056-00.54.23.144	Someone is motionless.
2034_Super_8_00.54.24.368-00.54.37.622	He stands, pulls out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES, toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance.
2034_Super_8_00.54.37.622-00.54.42.524	Another INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON WOOD and Someone backs up, nervous.
2034_Super_8_00.54.42.524-00.54.45.521	Another odd sound -- then ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO.
2034_Super_8_00.54.45.594-00.54.50.751	Someone's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.
2034_Super_8_00.54.50.751-00.54.54.562	Someone's car pulls up.
2034_Super_8_00.54.54.562-00.54.58.072	He gets out of the car.
2034_Super_8_00.54.58.072-00.55.02.486	Suddenly the three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed at Someone -- he is blinded -- tries to see.
2034_Super_8_00.55.12.057-00.55.13.279	Past an IV and medical machinery.
2034_Super_8_00.55.13.279-00.55.14.405	He is looking at someone we don't yet see.
2034_Super_8_00.55.14.405-00.55.16.382	In the background, Someone stands, watching.
2034_Super_8_00.55.16.382-00.55.19.642	Someone is quiet, simple.
2034_Super_8_00.55.19.642-00.55.21.016	Now we see who he is talking to.
2034_Super_8_00.55.23.255-00.55.26.250	Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
2034_Super_8_00.55.26.250-00.55.28.009	Someone swallows.
2034_Super_8_00.55.28.009-00.55.29.136	Feels that his time on Earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here.
2034_Super_8_00.55.42.419-00.55.50.811	By the door, Someone is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
2034_Super_8_00.55.55.548-00.55.57.984	Someone offers a vague, searching smile.
2034_Super_8_00.56.34.487-00.56.45.045	Someone moves to the door, he remains FACING CAMERA, his back to Someone, as Someone moves to the bed.
2034_Super_8_00.56.56.726-00.56.59.630	PUSH IN ON Someone's FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE.
2034_Super_8_00.57.00.538-00.57.01.712	Someone sleeps, power still out.
2034_Super_8_00.57.01.712-00.57.02.448	Then, a KNOCK.
2034_Super_8_00.57.02.448-00.57.03.327	He wakes up.
2034_Super_8_00.57.03.327-00.57.04.411	Another KNOCK.
2034_Super_8_00.57.04.411-00.57.11.512	His window.
2034_Super_8_00.57.11.512-00.57.13.850	He moves to it.
2034_Super_8_00.57.13.850-00.57.15.563	Opens it.
2034_Super_8_00.57.18.284-00.57.19.653	Someone is half asleep, but also stunned.
2034_Super_8_00.57.19.653-00.57.22.142	Very quietly.
2034_Super_8_00.57.32.431-00.57.38.702	And Someone climbs in.
2034_Super_8_00.57.46.470-00.57.47.582	Someone sits on the floor.
2034_Super_8_00.57.47.582-00.57.48.932	Someone does too.
2034_Super_8_00.57.48.932-00.57.50.834	It's odd and silent for a moment.
2034_Super_8_00.57.58.200-00.58.00.851	Someone stares, amazed at her.
2034_Super_8_00.58.36.806-00.58.39.920	And the POWER RETURNS -- Someone's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS.
2034_Super_8_00.58.40.107-00.58.43.523	Someone crawls to the projector to stop it -- but.
2034_Super_8_00.58.47.137-00.58.53.744	Someone moves closer to the screen.
2034_Super_8_00.58.53.744-00.58.54.825	Someone sits behind her.
2034_Super_8_00.58.54.825-00.58.57.156	She watches the film.
2034_Super_8_00.59.10.871-00.59.13.727	Can't take her eyes away.
2034_Super_8_00.59.52.505-00.59.54.674	A tear drops down Someone's face, though Someone can't see that.
2034_Super_8_00.59.56.261-00.59.57.330	Finally, quietly.
2034_Super_8_00.59.57.330-01.00.02.628	Watching his mother, Someone is quietly stunned.
2034_Super_8_01.01.26.395-01.01.29.271	Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
2034_Super_8_01.01.29.623-01.01.30.579	Someone turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS.
2034_Super_8_01.01.30.579-01.01.31.790	A sort of SHUDDER-HUM.
2034_Super_8_01.01.31.790-01.01.35.936	Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
2034_Super_8_01.01.35.936-01.01.40.338	People move to it.
2034_Super_8_01.01.46.779-01.01.48.996	The cube VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
2034_Super_8_01.01.48.996-01.01.51.994	Someone opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
2034_Super_8_01.01.51.994-01.01.54.172	They are amazed.
2034_Super_8_01.01.54.172-01.01.57.383	They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -.
2034_Super_8_01.01.57.383-01.02.02.489	FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Someone, his heart pounding.
2034_Super_8_01.02.05.525-01.02.20.836	He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
2034_Super_8_01.02.25.334-01.02.38.694	Someone enters the dark house quietly.
2034_Super_8_01.02.38.694-01.02.41.358	She steps carefully toward her room, when.
2034_Super_8_01.02.41.358-01.02.42.816	A tense beat, her mind races.
2034_Super_8_01.02.42.816-01.02.44.816	Breathe, Someone, just breathe.
2034_Super_8_01.03.15.939-01.03.18.437	This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.
2034_Super_8_01.03.18.437-01.03.22.805	Someone, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills.
2034_Super_8_01.03.22.805-01.03.28.847	The front door opens -- Someone comes out and yells, miserable.
2034_Super_8_01.03.28.847-01.03.35.949	But she is far gone -- Someone' mind races -- he runs to his BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her.
2034_Super_8_01.03.35.949-01.03.38.400	Someone, she wants to escape everywhere.
2034_Super_8_01.03.40.092-01.03.41.461	A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR turns onto the road.
2034_Super_8_01.03.41.461-01.03.44.075	Her father's car -- she makes a turn.
2034_Super_8_01.03.44.075-01.03.46.460	We are with Someone as he drive -- clearly drunk.
2034_Super_8_01.03.47.576-01.03.52.489	Someone makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating.
2034_Super_8_01.03.52.489-01.03.57.897	Someone sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS.
2034_Super_8_01.03.57.897-01.04.02.952	Someone GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?.
2034_Super_8_01.04.12.969-01.04.15.679	Someone is bleeding.
2034_Super_8_01.04.15.679-01.04.16.916	Badly hurt.
2034_Super_8_01.04.16.916-01.04.19.605	He adjusts himself -- painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW.
2034_Super_8_01.04.19.605-01.04.22.081	Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on.
2034_Super_8_01.04.22.719-01.04.29.045	Someone tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door.
2034_Super_8_01.04.29.045-01.04.36.753	-- when Someone finally gets out -- he runs from his car -- stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS.
2034_Super_8_01.04.47.265-01.04.55.096	The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an ominous PLUME OF SMOKE -- a far-off SIREN is HEARD.
2034_Super_8_01.05.02.909-01.05.06.576	Someone stands at the counter with Someone, who is in a bad mood.
2034_Super_8_01.05.10.985-01.05.12.513	Someone's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE.
2034_Super_8_01.05.13.024-01.05.13.792	He gives Someone his change.
2034_Super_8_01.05.18.905-01.05.21.422	Someone heads off -- Someone follows.
2034_Super_8_01.05.21.422-01.05.33.638	As Someone rides off with the film, Someone follows -- and we BOOM UP along the WATER TOWER as they go.
2034_Super_8_01.05.33.638-01.05.50.279	As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE -- unseen from the street.
2034_Super_8_01.05.53.113-01.05.55.501	As Someone ride their bikes up to his house.
2034_Super_8_01.05.58.471-01.06.04.610	Frustrated beyond belief, Someone goes inside.
2034_Super_8_01.06.04.610-01.06.06.346	Someone follows.
2034_Super_8_01.06.16.702-01.06.19.779	Someone threads the film into the projector.
2034_Super_8_01.06.19.779-01.06.22.383	And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: Someone, from the night of the train crash.
2034_Super_8_01.06.22.383-01.06.25.800	The scene plays as they filmed it.
2034_Super_8_01.06.25.800-01.06.33.611	THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Someone argue.
2034_Super_8_01.06.33.989-01.06.37.162	Someone's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?.
2034_Super_8_01.06.47.271-01.06.49.700	They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
2034_Super_8_01.06.49.700-01.06.51.655	Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS.
2034_Super_8_01.06.52.332-01.06.59.358	Someone moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
2034_Super_8_01.07.01.217-01.07.06.367	Someone moves forward.
2034_Super_8_01.07.06.367-01.07.08.434	Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
2034_Super_8_01.07.41.985-01.07.47.795	But Someone has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO.
2034_Super_8_01.07.47.795-01.07.51.373	But Someone has slapped Someone' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- Someone looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the.
2034_Super_8_01.07.51.373-01.08.01.522	FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame.
2034_Super_8_01.08.03.537-01.08.07.269	ON FILM -- then from outside: AN AIR RAID SIREN RAMPS, WHINING THROUGH THE TOWN.
2034_Super_8_01.08.07.269-01.08.09.259	The boys look at each other -- afraid.
2034_Super_8_01.08.09.259-01.08.12.958	QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT.
2034_Super_8_01.08.13.014-01.08.15.764	WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive.
2034_Super_8_01.08.15.764-01.08.21.439	NEIGHBORS coming from their homes in the MID-GROUND: confusion and talk, more VEHICLES.
2034_Super_8_01.08.21.439-01.08.22.863	Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO Someone, trying to make sense of this -- Someone calls to a passing adult, Someone
2034_Super_8_01.08.22.863-01.08.25.528	Someone POINTS -- Someone turns to look -- we PAN: THE DISTANT.
2034_Super_8_01.08.25.528-01.08.30.623	VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all the belongings they can.
2034_Super_8_01.08.30.623-01.08.34.561	Others quickly LOAD UP CARS, strapping belongings to the roof.
2034_Super_8_01.08.34.561-01.08.38.016	Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
2034_Super_8_01.09.32.124-01.09.34.172	He heads off.
2034_Super_8_01.09.34.172-01.09.35.803	ORDERS are being BARKED -- RESIDENTS can be heard, complaining and arguing.
2034_Super_8_01.09.35.803-01.09.37.082	Walkie SQUAWKS and PA ANNOUNCEMENTS as SOLDIERS check their wrist bands.
2034_Super_8_01.09.37.082-01.09.39.407	Someone passes an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER.
2034_Super_8_01.09.39.407-01.09.40.643	A THOUSAND PEOPLE so far.
2034_Super_8_01.09.54.827-01.09.56.007	Someone lies in a cot in the TRIAGE UNIT, fifty beds transferred from the hospital.
2034_Super_8_01.09.56.007-01.09.59.943	Someone stares off, head bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
2034_Super_8_01.09.59.943-01.10.05.205	Find Someone, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally sees Someone and hurries to him.
2034_Super_8_01.10.05.205-01.10.11.780	And Someone GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close.
2034_Super_8_01.10.12.173-01.10.15.689	In a voice desperate and heartsick, he says.
2034_Super_8_01.10.30.211-01.10.32.644	Someone's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS.
2034_Super_8_01.10.32.644-01.10.35.873	And Someone looks at him with hope.
2034_Super_8_01.10.38.442-01.10.41.059	They look at him like he is from Uranus.
2034_Super_8_01.10.58.654-01.11.01.984	Someone, Someone' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices.
2034_Super_8_01.11.01.984-01.11.04.158	Someone is in her face.
2034_Super_8_01.11.04.158-01.11.05.865	Someone suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously.
2034_Super_8_01.11.13.852-01.11.21.205	Someone looks RIGHT AS US, vulnerable, but seductive.
2034_Super_8_01.11.21.205-01.11.23.069	Now we see Someone, looking RIGHT AT US.
2034_Super_8_01.11.23.069-01.11.27.201	Utterly stunned.
2034_Super_8_01.11.38.829-01.11.43.913	MOVING PAST as Someone moves through PARKED CARS, people keeping up.
2034_Super_8_01.11.45.702-01.11.49.552	The boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by.
2034_Super_8_01.12.09.971-01.12.10.757	A small, tiled room, no windows.
2034_Super_8_01.12.10.757-01.12.12.787	Someone, up all night and pissed off, but bored being pissed off, POUNDS ON THE DOOR.
2034_Super_8_01.12.15.720-01.12.17.993	He POUNDS again.
2034_Super_8_01.12.17.993-01.12.20.613	The door finally unlocks and opens.
2034_Super_8_01.12.20.613-01.12.24.214	A 32-year-old humorless, armed SOLDIER stands there.
2034_Super_8_01.12.24.345-01.12.25.389	Someone is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall.
2034_Super_8_01.12.25.389-01.12.26.642	Soldier with the semi-auto behind him, aimed at his back.
2034_Super_8_01.12.26.642-01.12.28.441	As Someone passes an open door, he spies an empty office -- through the window on the tarmac are a few MILITARY VEHICLES, a handful of airmen.
2034_Super_8_01.12.28.441-01.12.30.710	Someone's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall -- Someone turns.
2034_Super_8_01.12.30.710-01.12.33.301	SLAM-FLATTENED BY Someone, who KNEELS to him.
2034_Super_8_01.12.33.301-01.12.35.042	PUSH IN CLOSE -- his eyes wide, mind racing -- WHAT THE HELL NEXT? CUT TO.
2034_Super_8_01.12.35.042-01.12.39.513	BEHIND A SOLDIER as he RUNS through the dark building -- oh shit -- he comes to a stop, back against the wall -- but PUSH IN on his face: IT'S Someone, IN AN AIR FORCE UNIFORM.
2034_Super_8_01.12.39.513-01.12.40.978	He is fucking scared; at least he is holding a rifle.
2034_Super_8_01.12.47.800-01.12.52.276	He peels around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS, VEHICLES.
2034_Super_8_01.12.52.276-01.12.57.556	Someone's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL TANK.
2034_Super_8_01.12.57.556-01.12.59.137	Eyes wild -- A METALLIC CLI-CHUNK AS HE UNSAFETIES THE.
2034_Super_8_01.12.59.137-01.13.04.502	A SOLDIER crosses to a vehicle, on his radio when KAFA- Someone! The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST! The airmen take cover, RUN TO MOVE NEARBY VEHICLES, GENERAL MAYHEM -- and our CAMERA BOOMS UP -- to the MILITARY JEEP THAT DRIVES.
2034_Super_8_01.13.04.502-01.13.08.123	Someone behind the wheel, he blasts the vehicle through the exit, along the road back to town.
2034_Super_8_01.13.08.123-01.13.19.699	Someone drives up in the jeep -- comes to a stop in SHOCKED CLOSE UP -- we see in the distance the MASS OF VEHICLES driving from town -- Someone's mind races.
2034_Super_8_01.13.24.365-01.13.28.894	The jeep RACES past camera -- we PAN -- revealing as.
2034_Super_8_01.13.28.894-01.13.31.562	Someone drives, Someone shotgun.
2034_Super_8_01.13.31.562-01.13.34.967	People in back.
2034_Super_8_01.13.56.119-01.14.01.178	Someone YANKS the steering wheel -- he turns onto a DIRT ROAD -- the car RUMBLES away from camera.
2034_Super_8_01.14.01.178-01.14.09.170	Someone's car pulls up, lights go off.
2034_Super_8_01.14.09.170-01.14.13.904	The kids pile out.
2034_Super_8_01.14.13.904-01.14.18.241	A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE.
2034_Super_8_01.14.18.241-01.14.23.071	They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON.
2034_Super_8_01.14.23.071-01.14.26.647	Someone tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it doesn't budge.
2034_Super_8_01.14.26.647-01.14.30.257	Someone hands the tire iron to Someone -- he tries -- nothing.
2034_Super_8_01.14.30.257-01.14.32.676	As Someone grabs the tire iron.

2034_Super_8_01.14.39.712-01.14.47.984	Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we are INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it all: THE MOTHER LODE.
2034_Super_8_01.14.49.273-01.14.53.763	The boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down the hall.
2034_Super_8_01.14.53.763-01.14.59.176	The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter.
2034_Super_8_01.14.59.176-01.15.01.651	We are looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes.
2034_Super_8_01.15.01.651-01.15.05.968	Someone threads the film.
2034_Super_8_01.15.06.918-01.15.08.637	Someone holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB.

2034_Super_8_01.16.34.396-01.16.37.924	Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the alien -- IT'S Someone.

2034_Super_8_01.17.12.054-01.17.14.594	Just then a MUFFLED SHATTER-CRASH.
2034_Super_8_01.17.21.602-01.17.25.834	Suddenly BOOM! The doors BURST OPEN and ARMED COMMANDOS.

2034_Super_8_01.17.47.295-01.17.49.550	Someone moves to them.
2034_Super_8_01.17.49.550-01.17.53.591	Someone CHECKS THEIR POCKETS as Someone TAKES Someone's BACKPACK, opens it -- pulls out some FIREWORKS.
2034_Super_8_01.17.58.658-01.18.01.952	Someone's terrified as Someone pulls from Someone's pocket a couple COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
2034_Super_8_01.18.01.952-01.18.02.737	Drops everything but the necklace.
2034_Super_8_01.18.02.737-01.18.04.087	Someone reacts, panicked.
2034_Super_8_01.18.04.087-01.18.07.629	Someone's on the verge of tears as Someone POCKETS the necklace.
2034_Super_8_01.18.07.629-01.18.12.639	Off the TERRIFIED BOYS as they are ushered away.
2034_Super_8_01.18.12.639-01.18.23.729	The BOYS are put onto the bus -- BOOM DOWN to Someone's CAR IN THE FOREGROUND, where we realize that WE HAVEN'T BEEN THE ONLY AUDIENCE TO THIS: Someone, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus DRIVES AWAY.
2034_Super_8_01.18.23.729-01.18.26.256	His stoned mind races.
2034_Super_8_01.18.26.256-01.18.31.251	Staying hidden from the remaining military, Someone scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9, grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic.
2034_Super_8_01.18.33.766-01.18.39.511	Someone moves fast through the crowded evac area.
2034_Super_8_01.19.10.440-01.19.19.902	Someone reads Someone's SCIENCE FICTION MAGAZINE -- suddenly Someone is there, grabs him and pulls him up.
2034_Super_8_01.19.29.024-01.19.33.543	PAN as Someone moves back -- we PUSH IN on Someone, who sits near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES.
2034_Super_8_01.19.33.543-01.19.37.208	Someone sits, which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another Airman, Someone, 40, sits too.
2034_Super_8_01.19.37.208-01.19.40.873	PUSH PAST THEM toward our four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
2034_Super_8_01.20.02.411-01.20.03.638	GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Someone SCREAMS, hurt -- At the front of the bus, Someone FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN.
2034_Super_8_01.20.03.638-01.20.05.148	The bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS.
2034_Super_8_01.20.05.148-01.20.07.603	The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel.
2034_Super_8_01.20.07.603-01.20.09.121	The bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS! We.
2034_Super_8_01.20.09.121-01.20.10.794	The kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES.
2034_Super_8_01.20.35.638-01.20.41.865	PUSH IN on Someone, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED.
2034_Super_8_01.21.33.653-01.21.35.725	Someone SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt.
2034_Super_8_01.21.35.725-01.21.37.976	BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD.
2034_Super_8_01.21.37.976-01.21.42.391	Windows SHATTER -- people -- seatbelts removed -- LAND ON People! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window- floor painfully -- Someone so hard he is INSTANTLY.
2034_Super_8_01.21.48.629-01.21.49.805	Someone rises.
2034_Super_8_01.21.49.805-01.21.51.257	Scared, but pissed.
2034_Super_8_01.21.51.257-01.21.53.084	The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW.
2034_Super_8_01.21.53.084-01.21.54.139	The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY.
2034_Super_8_01.21.54.139-01.21.56.173	Someone moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the handle -- but it's never gonna open.
2034_Super_8_01.22.27.542-01.22.45.163	On the OTHER side of the glass, Someone rights himself, momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.
2034_Super_8_01.22.49.585-01.22.53.401	And there is people, face-to-face -- Someone seeing the fear in Someone's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate.
2034_Super_8_01.22.58.597-01.23.02.312	Somehow Someone takes this moment to look into Someone's face -- to silently -- in a look -- repent.
2034_Super_8_01.23.02.312-01.23.03.273	Instantly, Someone knows he is about to watch this man's life end.
2034_Super_8_01.23.03.273-01.23.06.877	SMASH! Someone turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door -- SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER.
2034_Super_8_01.23.06.877-01.23.12.040	So it can get inside.
2034_Super_8_01.23.17.803-01.23.25.583	Someone hits again -- so does the creature -- as Someone RUNS OUT OF AMMO.
2034_Super_8_01.23.25.583-01.23.38.002	Someone hits again and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the boys -- all covering their face -- Someone seeing the CREATURE.
2034_Super_8_01.23.38.002-01.23.44.817	With all the boys helping, Someone pulls himself up -- outside the bus, Someone peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to Someone -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Someone strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
2034_Super_8_01.24.06.725-01.24.08.874	TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM.
2034_Super_8_01.24.16.311-01.24.22.670	And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Someone says, eerily quietly, terrified.
2034_Super_8_01.24.34.788-01.24.39.675	Standing is hard for heartsick Someone, his legs so hurt -- suddenly Someone IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force.
2034_Super_8_01.24.39.675-01.24.44.602	As the two Soldiers head off, Someone wraps Someone' arm over his shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Someone looks him over, confused.
2034_Super_8_01.24.47.915-01.24.50.120	On Someone' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE.
2034_Super_8_01.24.50.894-01.24.54.053	Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Someone pulls out his MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
2034_Super_8_01.24.54.053-01.24.56.742	WIDEN to see that he is taken the necklace from Someone's dead body.
2034_Super_8_01.25.00.552-01.25.03.017	Someone holds up his backpack.
2034_Super_8_01.25.03.017-01.25.09.246	They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON Someone who studies the oncoming car, as behind him.
2034_Super_8_01.25.09.246-01.25.15.361	The car ARRIVES: It's Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.25.15.361-01.25.18.579	He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them.
2034_Super_8_01.25.18.579-01.25.24.793	Someone looks at Someone, like it hurts to think.
2034_Super_8_01.25.32.374-01.25.35.636	Someone drives, Someone is ASLEEP.
2034_Super_8_01.25.35.636-01.25.38.511	Other boys in the back.
2034_Super_8_01.25.45.728-01.25.47.919	Someone quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Someone's eyes go wide -- they are stuck.
2034_Super_8_01.26.02.073-01.26.06.757	GUNFIRE CONTINUES.
2034_Super_8_01.26.06.757-01.26.11.215	Someone and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES.
2034_Super_8_01.26.11.215-01.26.13.835	Soldier hurries off.
2034_Super_8_01.26.13.835-01.26.19.059	Someone in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO SHIT in collateral damage.
2034_Super_8_01.26.58.175-01.27.04.976	An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside.
2034_Super_8_01.27.04.976-01.27.21.156	-- they run in for cover -- they are silhouetted in this dark space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
2034_Super_8_01.27.21.156-01.27.23.502	They are all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN.
2034_Super_8_01.27.23.502-01.27.24.960	Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures sway.
2034_Super_8_01.27.26.620-01.27.30.722	Someone grabs a coke on the counter.
2034_Super_8_01.27.33.892-01.27.36.278	Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and the creature ROARING -- And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- Someone realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts.
2034_Super_8_01.27.36.278-01.27.41.254	Someone runs -- the others follow.
2034_Super_8_01.27.41.254-01.27.48.542	But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT A WALL! They all go down -- but Someone is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete.
2034_Super_8_01.27.52.992-01.27.56.264	But there's blood and Someone is in real pain.
2034_Super_8_01.27.58.109-01.28.00.674	Someone wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be seen driving past outside.
2034_Super_8_01.28.00.674-01.28.03.157	Someone hands Someone the thick fabric tie -- which Someone fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it around Someone's leg, tight.
2034_Super_8_01.28.03.157-01.28.05.163	Someone looks at Someone -- can't argue.
2034_Super_8_01.28.07.531-01.28.10.338	Someone nods -- Someone looks to Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.28.16.763-01.28.21.280	Someone screams.
2034_Super_8_01.28.21.280-01.28.25.315	People run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated.
2034_Super_8_01.28.25.315-01.28.29.601	The only lone figures in town.
2034_Super_8_01.28.34.042-01.28.35.190	People stop, out of breath, at the graves.
2034_Super_8_01.28.35.190-01.28.37.227	People run through the graveyard and over to the.
2034_Super_8_01.28.37.227-01.28.38.866	They are out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT.
2034_Super_8_01.28.45.433-01.28.48.938	The SECOND door.
2034_Super_8_01.28.48.938-01.28.50.103	Dirt-caked windows.
2034_Super_8_01.28.50.103-01.28.51.402	The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
2034_Super_8_01.28.51.402-01.29.10.571	The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we are looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure.
2034_Super_8_01.29.10.571-01.29.13.271	The boys catch their breath.
2034_Super_8_01.29.14.598-01.29.17.531	Someone opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
2034_Super_8_01.29.17.531-01.29.21.434	LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN.
2034_Super_8_01.29.21.434-01.29.25.054	The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
2034_Super_8_01.29.25.054-01.29.29.028	But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
2034_Super_8_01.29.31.738-01.29.33.928	A JEEP roars past.
2034_Super_8_01.29.34.379-01.29.37.192	Someone drives fast.
2034_Super_8_01.29.37.192-01.29.38.039	Someone sits beside him.
2034_Super_8_01.29.38.039-01.29.39.316	It's awkward.
2034_Super_8_01.29.39.316-01.29.40.321	But not angry.
2034_Super_8_01.29.40.321-01.29.42.189	Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad.
2034_Super_8_01.29.42.189-01.29.45.681	Someone looks at him for a moment, then back to the road.
2034_Super_8_01.30.01.749-01.30.08.161	A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude.
2034_Super_8_01.30.08.957-01.30.11.818	Someone wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
2034_Super_8_01.30.26.699-01.30.28.469	Someone begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
2034_Super_8_01.30.28.469-01.30.30.220	Someone lands on the bottom.
2034_Super_8_01.30.30.220-01.30.36.425	Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Someone climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above him.
2034_Super_8_01.30.36.425-01.30.37.607	Now Cry lands too.
2034_Super_8_01.30.37.607-01.30.39.675	There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
2034_Super_8_01.30.39.675-01.30.42.039	Someone's mind races about which way to go.
2034_Super_8_01.30.48.087-01.30.51.769	They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL.
2034_Super_8_01.30.51.769-01.30.56.338	We are SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
2034_Super_8_01.31.02.443-01.31.14.225	They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING ROOM.
2034_Super_8_01.31.14.225-01.31.17.819	They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT THROUGH A HOUSE.
2034_Super_8_01.31.17.819-01.31.21.591	They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION -- where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
2034_Super_8_01.31.21.591-01.31.24.027	There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS.
2034_Super_8_01.31.24.027-01.31.29.017	The RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now.
2034_Super_8_01.31.29.017-01.31.33.602	People slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once.
2034_Super_8_01.31.33.602-01.31.36.722	They cross to the other side.
2034_Super_8_01.31.36.722-01.31.37.825	Someone bumps into a HANGING Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.31.37.825-01.31.42.033	Someone is about to scream, but Someone puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.31.42.033-01.31.51.377	Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other TUNNELS are visible from here, too.
2034_Super_8_01.31.51.377-01.31.53.301	People look at the space in disbelief.
2034_Super_8_01.31.53.301-01.31.55.577	Then Someone sees something that makes him grab at Someone's shirt.
2034_Super_8_01.31.55.577-01.31.58.092	Someone looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND.
2034_Super_8_01.32.02.113-01.32.03.228	IT'S A HUMAN LEG.
2034_Super_8_01.32.03.228-01.32.06.573	People would SCREAM if they didn't need to stay quiet.
2034_Super_8_01.32.06.573-01.32.08.297	In a panicked WHISPER.
2034_Super_8_01.32.22.578-01.32.25.968	Someone moves away from Someone to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING.
2034_Super_8_01.32.26.071-01.32.26.995	TIGHT ON Someone as he sees, among them, Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.32.26.995-01.32.27.611	His heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples.
2034_Super_8_01.32.27.611-01.32.33.206	Someone sees her too.
2034_Super_8_01.32.45.194-01.32.49.342	Stay with Someone, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES, glancing up to make sure he is out of the creature's view.
2034_Super_8_01.32.50.060-01.32.56.259	MOVE FAST with Someone as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now.
2034_Super_8_01.32.56.259-01.33.04.324	Someone runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space -- he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it -- he disappears down the tunnel.
2034_Super_8_01.33.05.025-01.33.07.065	Someone's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
2034_Super_8_01.33.07.065-01.33.09.651	The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL Someone, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space.
2034_Super_8_01.33.09.651-01.33.13.410	He sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.33.23.678-01.33.25.489	Someone's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light.
2034_Super_8_01.33.25.489-01.33.27.238	FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
2034_Super_8_01.33.27.238-01.33.31.497	Someone watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS.
2034_Super_8_01.33.31.497-01.33.35.532	Someone frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT.
2034_Super_8_01.34.29.745-01.34.33.787	She is CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed.
2034_Super_8_01.34.40.557-01.34.56.123	She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful -- during which -- quietly.
2034_Super_8_01.34.56.123-01.35.00.891	But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense.
2034_Super_8_01.35.00.891-01.35.05.199	Someone, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up.
2034_Super_8_01.35.17.975-01.35.22.929	People have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: Someone.
2034_Super_8_01.35.22.929-01.35.26.490	They are out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in.
2034_Super_8_01.35.31.042-01.35.36.259	People follow.
2034_Super_8_01.35.36.259-01.35.37.995	They run into a tunnel.
2034_Super_8_01.35.42.926-01.35.46.460	He takes off.
2034_Super_8_01.35.46.460-01.35.49.202	Sparkler lighting the way, we are with people -- people behind them.
2034_Super_8_01.36.05.793-01.36.10.773	terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction! After RUNNING HARD for a beat: They haul ass, but after a long moment Someone IS GRABBED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them -- They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
2034_Super_8_01.36.20.892-01.36.22.057	A DIRT WALL.
2034_Super_8_01.36.25.332-01.36.28.130	Out of breath, they turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.
2034_Super_8_01.36.28.130-01.36.31.606	The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the.
2034_Super_8_01.36.31.606-01.36.35.393	AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM.
2034_Super_8_01.36.35.393-01.36.39.188	REALLY LOOKS AT HIM.
2034_Super_8_01.37.39.894-01.37.51.452	AND AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN.
2034_Super_8_01.37.51.452-01.38.16.757	Someone backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY.
2034_Super_8_01.40.21.118-01.41.22.215	FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Someone LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it out.
2034_Super_8_01.41.22.215-01.41.25.434	HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
2034_Super_8_01.41.25.434-01.41.26.548	Someone knows what this means.
2034_Super_8_01.41.26.548-01.41.27.653	AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION -- FROM HERE UNTIL THE END.
2034_Super_8_01.41.27.653-01.41.28.280	After a long beat, Someone HOLDS THE NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING.
2034_Super_8_01.41.28.280-01.41.28.955	TEARS in Someone's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.
2034_Super_8_01.41.28.955-01.41.31.564	Someone, heartsick, watches his son, on the verge of letting go.
2034_Super_8_01.41.31.564-01.41.32.380	Someone watches Someone, on the verge of tears -- except Someone just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not ever.
2034_Super_8_01.41.32.425-01.41.34.350	Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN.
2034_Super_8_01.41.34.350-01.41.36.300	And we see what's inside.
2034_Super_8_01.41.36.300-01.41.39.273	A PHOTOGRAPH of Someone's MOTHER.
2034_Super_8_01.41.39.273-01.41.41.302	A young woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY.
2034_Super_8_01.41.41.302-01.41.44.247	And Someone looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Someone's eyes suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Someone, too, tears streaming down her face and finally Someone reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all Someone needed, really.
2034_Super_8_01.41.48.963-01.41.54.066	Someone LETS GO.
2034_Super_8_01.41.54.066-01.41.59.796	OUR SCORE SOARS AS, IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP.
2034_Super_8_01.42.32.490-01.42.40.555	STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and that's when Someone sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE.
2034_Super_8_01.42.41.670-01.42.45.036	And we PUSH IN on people, who watch, amazed, as the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY.
2034_Super_8_01.42.47.708-01.42.54.132	And we PUSH IN as Someone SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING SHIP seen in his windshield.
2034_Super_8_01.42.54.898-01.43.01.969	People watch, amazed, as the ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON Someone's HAND, as it takes Someone's.
2034_Super_8_01.43.04.575-01.43.13.138	And looking skyward, Someone smiles.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.02.43.080-00.02.46.750	Someone steps away, not wanting to ponder Someone's balls anymore than she has to.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.02.48.460-00.02.56.760	She walks in on a shouting match between Someone, a leftist angry news writer, and Someone, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.04.03.911-00.04.06.455	Someone, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.04.07.623-00.04.10.584	They all laugh.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.04.59.090-00.05.11.102	Someone talks to Someone, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.05.15.649-00.05.19.277	Someone looks worried.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.05.35.335-00.05.37.379	Someone nods.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.05.42.760-00.05.45.554	She rips out an extra two feet of floss.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.06.08.952-00.06.24.384	She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony PROFILE and PHOTO.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.06.18.838-00.06.21.089	Someone stops flossing and looks at Someone.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.07.42.963-00.07.46.299	There's an awkward silence between them.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.07.50.011-00.07.53.556	She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.12.29.666-00.12.31.335	She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.08.48.945-00.08.51.448	He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.09.00.874-00.09.08.006	He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.01.851-00.10.04.104	Someone shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.10.653-00.10.17.867	He mimes swallowing.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.20.411-00.10.26.126	WE PAN off the television to the bed, where Someone now watches, appalled.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.17.243-00.10.19.661	Someone hangs up the phone.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.20.078-00.10.25.959	Someone, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.10.25.959-00.10.42.392	WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Someone continues his rant.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.11.24.809-00.11.27.812	Irritated, Someone begins to compulsively remake her bed.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.11.42.869-00.11.46.080	Someone bowls over LAUGHING.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.12.32.585-00.12.38.549	People make their way into the conference room.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.12.40.426-00.12.42.679	People are already there.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.12.46.724-00.12.49.227	ON TV: Someone's face appears.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.04.218-00.14.05.845	Someone looks at Someone.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.13.20.759-00.13.22.760	Someone holds up a piece of paper.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.23.738-00.14.28.159	Someone is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.28.159-00.14.29.577	A KNOCK.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.28.993-00.14.31.412	Then the door opens and Someone appears.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.33.331-00.14.37.293	Someone glares at him.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.51.894-00.14.55.895	He stares at her, surprised.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.17.13.257-00.17.19.949	Someone and the control room crew watch the proceedings.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.17.13.274-00.17.17.280	In the control room, Someone smirks.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.17.31.902-00.17.33.648	Cliff shrugs.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.19.05.618-00.19.08.636	In the control room, Someone looks like she is going to pass out.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.19.47.712-00.19.49.518	Someone grabs Georgia and kisses her hard.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.19.54.328-00.19.58.014	After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.27.06.050-00.27.12.531	She fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.27.37.881-00.27.44.110	He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner placed in the center.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.27.44.110-00.27.45.765	Several books rest beside it.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.27.45.765-00.27.51.321	Beside the table, a man plays violin.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.28.00.745-00.28.03.183	Someone exits the stage door and walks into the alley, followed by the confused camera crew.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.28.55.457-00.29.01.562	ON THE MONITOR -- A slightly puzzled look from Someone, but he lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.28.31.178-00.28.37.014	As Someone waves to camera, he is pulled into the Jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.29.29.158-00.29.35.883	Someone walks in, covered in Jello, to find Someone standing there, arms crossed, quietly containing her rage.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.30.04.260-00.30.06.012	She walks off.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.30.06.012-00.30.11.421	Confused by her reaction, he follows.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.30.11.421-00.30.14.498	CLOSE ON Someone, wearing a grave expression.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.30.14.969-00.30.15.242	Someone nods, uncomfortable.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.23.49.862-00.23.56.785	But a moment later, she is looking back in the window, to see -- Someone step out of the shower.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.24.06.323-00.24.12.773	Someone leans closer to see Someone start flossing, wearing only a towel.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.24.13.843-00.24.15.067	She freezes.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.31.11.145-00.31.14.899	Someone approaches them.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.34.05.494-00.34.07.647	A concerned look from Someone as the phone rings.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.34.15.130-00.34.18.183	She thinks, looks at the phone again.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.35.41.390-00.35.44.387	A long pause.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.36.07.083-00.36.11.265	He hustles her out of the room.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.10.32.364-00.10.40.357	Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is crossing the street.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.10.33.157-00.10.36.841	Someone HITS the BRAKES HARD and Someone flies forward, palms to the window.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.10.33.841-00.10.35.221	The brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and Someone flies back onto his bed.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.10.51.359-00.10.51.975	BANG! The bus rockets forward once more.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.10.55.184-00.10.58.053	As Someone rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of Someone's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.11.11.749-00.11.14.924	Someone shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.11.33.646-00.11.34.846	Someone nods and, as he does, Someone's eyes shift.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.11.48.544-00.11.50.412	Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly toward the Knight Bus.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.11.50.412-00.12.03.382	Before can scream, the entire Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.11.58.882-00.12.00.181	The Shrunken Head winces.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.12.32.940-00.12.36.382	As the Knight Bus rockets off, people are revealed, Someone glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE LEAKY CAULDRON.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.12.33.683-00.12.43.016	Someone drags Someone's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car alarm.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.12.49.452-00.12.53.277	The BARTENDER glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.12.44.877-00.12.47.703	A solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.13.34.016-00.13.35.652	Then Someone turns.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.13.44.667-00.13.46.738	Someone glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to Someone, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut sliver.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.14.51.327-00.15.01.910	THROUGH the window: the rooftops of London.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.14.57.110-00.15.03.459	A TRAIN PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Someone, standing with Someone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.15.00.270-00.15.05.884	He turns, eyes his schoolbooks.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.15.05.884-00.15.09.163	He studies the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then gives the rope a tug.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.15.23.835-00.15.25.764	Instantly the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers SNAPPING.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.15.24.564-00.15.27.095	Someone gives chase, then the book turns, begins NIPPING viciously at his shoes.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.15.27.095-00.15.33.002	Someone vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a pillow.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.07.500-00.16.10.686	Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Someone POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled beneath the pillow.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.14.065-00.16.24.478	Someone exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a door.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.15.543-00.16.18.590	As she opens the door, she is greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR and a RUSH of WIND.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.25.837-00.16.29.266	Looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking RAT (SCABBERS), pursued by a decidedly UGLY ORANGE CAT (CROOKSHANKS).
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.35.629-00.16.38.893	As Someone moves down the stairs, VOICES come from below.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.38.293-00.16.47.079	As Someone reaches bottom, he finds Someone protectively cradling Scabbers, while Someone does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.48.479-00.16.50.453	Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.54.173-00.16.54.944	In the accompanying PHOTO, the entire Someone FAMILY stands before the GREAT PYRAMIDS, waving.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.16.54.565-00.16.56.822	Smack in the middle is Someone, Scabbers perched on his shoulder.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.17.15.094-00.17.17.374	Someone takes Someone's face in her hands, smiles.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.17.56.270-00.17.58.289	Someone's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.18.09.695-00.18.10.638	Someone hesitates, unable to continue.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.18.40.490-00.18.42.768	Someone hesitates yet again.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.19.30.135-00.19.32.071	She points.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.20.32.578-00.20.33.395	Lanterns flicker.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.20.21.502-00.20.23.217	The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.20.17.479-00.20.21.242	Someone rises, slides open the door, peers into the corridor.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.20.20.342-00.20.21.977	Someone's POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.20.20.777-00.20.28.462	Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -- and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and die.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.21.17.052-00.21.18.544	A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Someone's mouth.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.22.41.627-00.22.44.955	Someone's glasses.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.23.14.934-00.23.25.301	As he leaves, Someone turns to people.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.23.47.565-00.23.48.540	She shakes her head.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.24.12.059-00.24.20.049	Gradually, the sweet sound of a CHOIR rises on the air, a FLASH of LIGHTNING bleaches the night sky and we cut to Great Hall.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_00.24.17.802-00.24.24.091	the CAMERA as it GLIDES TOWARD the windows of the Great Hall, TOWARD the CANDLELIT SILHOUETTES glimmering within, PASSING THROUGH the glass.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.14.18.201-01.14.21.003	But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING, scowling in the glare of Someone's wand light.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.14.24.917-01.14.30.961	Someone makes to follow, then stops.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.15.09.066-01.15.14.283	The WAND'S SPOT dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.15.20.167-01.15.23.210	into the harsh glare of Someone's wand.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.16.11.394-01.16.16.413	To Someone's horror, words begin to appear.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.16.16.911-01.16.18.408	Someone studies him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.20.03.557-01.20.05.731	Stung, Someone starts to reply, but -- remarkably -- seems incapable of a single word.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.20.05.731-01.20.14.983	Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.10.063-01.21.12.766	the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly DARKENS.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.16.365-01.21.21.978	Leaning close, Someone watches the shape that appears.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.21.219-01.21.25.366	It is unmistakable: Someone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.25.366-01.21.27.391	Just then, a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.30.559-01.21.31.334	He wheels, finds.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.37.040-01.21.38.693	Someone stiffens.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.54.103-01.21.59.915	When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Someone's shoulder.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.21.59.915-01.22.00.335	Her hand.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.22.05.867-01.22.07.176	Someone shakes his head.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.22.29.270-01.22.37.239	SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.22.35.139-01.22.38.880	As he sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we -- cut to People.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.22.42.985-01.22.46.365	hurrying past.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.22.52.557-01.22.57.729	The Executioner looks up and we.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.23.02.542-01.23.06.609	Someone, leading people toward Someone's hut.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.23.19.631-01.23.22.811	Someone stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Someone jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.23.22.877-01.23.25.732	She turns, surprised Someone's spoken to her.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.23.37.076-01.23.38.654	Someone nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Someone's jaw, putting him flat on his back.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.23.38.654-01.23.44.173	Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, people huffing and puffing behind.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.24.01.871-01.24.16.335	The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.24.12.715-01.24.15.150	Someone stands by the window watching Buckbeak.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.24.31.562-01.24.32.495	People sit.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.25.59.508-01.26.07.707	The trio slip silently into a stand of trees.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.26.33.293-01.26.33.840	Beyond them, Someone's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.26.48.566-01.26.50.432	High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.26.52.589-01.26.59.031	The trio stops, fighting their tears.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.04.430-01.27.05.633	A QUARTET OF BLEAK SHADOWS files from the hut.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.27.398-01.27.29.450	A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the breeze and people stare toward the trees in numb disbelief.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.28.250-01.27.31.223	Someone, face turned away, trembles.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.28.378-01.27.33.554	Slowly, Someone's hand falls onto Someone's shoulder and CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of Someone's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from his finger, drops like a tear.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.41.166-01.27.42.969	Someone stares at his hand.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.39.364-01.27.39.537	At the blood running down his finger.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.35.863-01.27.36.419	His eyes shift.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.36.419-01.27.40.896	See Scabbers streaking away.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.43.269-01.27.50.468	As Someone pelts after Scabbers, people give chase.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.50.926-01.27.54.215	Someone reaches the summit, disappears over the top.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.27.54.515-01.27.57.329	People follow.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.28.07.709-01.28.11.284	Looks toward Someone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.28.11.284-01.28.12.345	Someone's eyes shift.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.28.11.307-01.28.13.268	Bounding toward him in the gathering gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-Someone DOG.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.28.29.875-01.28.30.138	Someone raises his chin.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.28.25.658-01.28.32.921	The dog vanishes into the GAP at the base of the tree, begins to pull Someone through.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.11.030-01.30.14.699	Then, abruptly, the tunnel ends.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.13.640-01.30.17.496	Confused, people glance about, then -- as one -- peer up.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.12.399-01.30.12.911	A small opening.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.41.878-01.30.43.240	They come out, look down.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.43.140-01.30.44.413	A wide, shiny stripe cuts through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps from a door.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.48.245-01.30.52.639	Someone looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.30.54.484-01.31.01.912	Someone looks up slowly at the MAN standing in the shadows.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.38.47.793-01.38.53.083	Someone studies Someone briefly, looks away.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.15.777-01.39.23.232	He turns, see Someone staring at the FULL MOON.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.28.383-01.39.30.019	His eyes shift.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.32.387-01.39.37.000	Someone is a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.41.528-01.39.43.389	Someone, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.43.714-01.39.46.250	Someone's eyes dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note the WAND trembling in Someone's LENGTHENING FIST.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.39.43.750-01.39.45.988	As Someone's WAND DROPS Someone LEAPS.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.42.58.021-01.43.01.759	Someone looks into his glassy eyes.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.43.35.763-01.43.36.966	Someone's Patronus blooms briefly and dies.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.06.778-01.44.07.680	Someone GASPS.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.07.334-01.44.15.208	SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving him.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.20.138-01.44.23.640	Then a LIGHT splinters the trees.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.26.144-01.44.34.590	Someone squints, sees a FIERY STAG appear.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.33.790-01.44.36.795	its body luminous.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.35.695-01.44.36.886	slashing through the trees.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.37.194-01.44.37.728	sowing light in the darkness.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.34.728-01.44.35.694	Still, the stag charges on.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.35.694-01.44.37.570	The LIGHT EXPANDS.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.37.570-01.44.38.408	The forest blazing with it.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.44.38.408-01.44.42.114	The remaining Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.14.373-01.45.17.485	The light ebbs.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.16.485-01.45.17.688	The stag's luminous body flickers.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.17.688-01.45.19.566	There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the size of a PEARL.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.15.066-01.45.19.321	in the palm of MAN, standing deep in the trees.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.19.588-01.45.22.350	Someone studies the strangely familiar SILHOUETTE, then it is gone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.45.46.080-01.45.50.128	out of Someone's SHADOW, which ripples against the curtain that encircles Someone's bed.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.46.06.668-01.46.08.411	Someone lies opposite, his leg BANDAGED.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.46.04.100-01.46.05.355	Someone paces.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.46.04.855-01.46.06.207	Stops.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.19.679-01.47.24.550	Someone hands people each a stick of CHOCOLATE, then starts to go.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.28.835-01.47.29.672	stops.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.32.634-01.47.34.587	He smiles, exits.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.38.744-01.47.39.621	Someone glances curiously at the chocolate.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.39.621-01.47.44.840	But Someone doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's long chain around Someone's neck as well as her own.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.47.45.132-01.47.50.980	As people exchange a curious glance, the BELL continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.06.228-01.48.10.168	At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is Empty.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.09.925-01.48.11.321	Except for people.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.08.218-01.48.13.369	As Someone unloops the necklace, Someone glances around in confusion.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.13.369-01.48.15.740	Someone ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the wall.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.57.296-01.49.00.288	She holds up a hand, silencing him.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.57.536-01.48.58.291	Annoyed, Someone follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.58.011-01.48.59.335	Dumbfounded, Someone turns.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.48.59.667-01.49.01.426	Someone holds up the HOURGLASS.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.49.22.885-01.49.24.080	A soft SMACK is HEARD.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.49.24.244-01.49.25.300	They turn, see Someone land on the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his kisser.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.49.28.303-01.49.32.784	Someone pulls Someone under the bridge.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.49.32.784-01.49.38.313	Seconds later, FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.50.01.294-01.50.02.250	Seconds later, Someone emerges, marvels at the sight of himself and Someone, and Someone heading down the slope to Someone's hut.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.50.08.558-01.50.09.806	His eyes shift to the pumpkin patch.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.50.46.234-01.50.48.263	Someone nods, then looks toward the hut.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.50.49.654-01.50.51.771	Inside, Someone is handing Scabbers to Someone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.50.57.761-01.50.59.934	As he starts to rise, Someone grabs him, speaks fiercely.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.15.545-01.51.20.275	Someone turns, watches Someone and the others drawing closer.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.20.275-01.51.22.665	She frowns, glances into the hut.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.26.733-01.51.30.630	Just then on the ground beside her Someone notices a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.30.630-01.51.36.220	Instantly, she grabs it, rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.35.820-01.51.36.764	SMASH! The sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.51.39.217-01.51.42.864	Someone ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of Someone's head.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.52.48.947-01.52.52.618	The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.52.58.026-01.53.05.371	As Someone vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at his ankles, pecking at his feet.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.53.39.899-01.53.42.018	Buckbeak refuses to move.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.54.30.377-01.54.34.926	People shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into the forest.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.54.35.884-01.54.40.838	just as Someone concludes his reverie.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.55.21.915-01.55.22.537	Quickly, the confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.55.29.324-01.55.31.763	The CROWS SCATTER to the skies.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.55.32.063-01.55.37.132	People race through the trees as Buckbeak lopes easily behind.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.55.37.132-01.55.41.551	SUBJECTIVE POV, GLIDING THROUGH a thicket of trees, TO the forest's edge, the trees thinning, REVEALING.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.55.59.420-01.56.01.559	the Whomping Willow THRASHING.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.00.543-01.56.04.616	As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Someone takes a stick, pokes a knot on the trunk.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.03.516-01.56.08.557	Instantly, the Willow calms.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.27.932-01.56.29.907	We look UPWARD, see the tops of the trees etched against the darkening sky.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.29.307-01.56.35.522	BATS fly TOWARD us.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.35.522-01.56.40.311	We FOLLOW one, when Buckbeak snags one.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.39.911-01.56.40.436	A tail twitches briefly between his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.52.219-01.56.55.196	People sit together in the lengthening shadows.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.56.55.586-01.56.58.850	Someone looks at Someone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.57.23.445-01.57.28.729	Someone nods, not wanting to press Someone further, then glances beyond the trees, toward the Whomping Willow.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.58.04.175-01.58.05.695	SHADOWS emerge under a FULL MOON: Someone.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.58.01.973-01.58.05.059	Someone glances toward the Willow.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.58.34.062-01.58.34.970	Someone looks back to the tall grass.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_01.58.34.662-01.58.36.681	The werewolf is frozen.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.00.57.238-02.00.59.915	Someone eyes Someone warily.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.00.59.277-02.01.00.449	He is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.01.830-02.01.03.535	The Lake begins to freeze.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.01.136-02.01.06.776	WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.06.888-02.01.08.709	She looks.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.08.709-02.01.13.648	Desperately, her eyes flash to the cyclone, to the pitiful sight of people at the water's edge.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.16.255-02.01.17.172	He draws his wand.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.13.667-02.01.16.336	Someone slashes through the trees, down to the rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father appeared.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.16.336-02.01.20.029	Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.20.029-02.01.23.126	A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST, then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.21.435-02.01.22.204	Someone stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.27.885-02.01.35.168	Across the lake, the Dementors retreat.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.01.36.137-02.01.45.982	Someone waits, still as a statue, until each and every one is gone.
2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.02.07.061-02.02.10.471	Then he simply lets his arm drop.

2054_Harry_Potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_02.05.43.682-02.05.44.929	As people enter.
